INTRODUCTION Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has been demonstrated to reduce the cost and lead time associated with manufacturing of complex components with internal features and novel alloys.
The AM processes are changing the design and manufacturing of liquid rocket engines components such as injectors, combustion chambers, nozzles, valves, and other fluid and struc- tural systems.
While additive manufacturing is continuing to evolve, it is still in its infancy, and over the past 10 years, the materials available have been limited.1 As AM is considered for a design application, the designer has been forced to use the limited available materials, which may not be the optimal material for performance.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion ( advance new materials for liquid rocket engine (LRE) applications such as hydrogen environments.
One such material being developed is e-Ni superalloy designed to resist high pressure, hydro- gen environment embrittlement, oxidation, and corrosion.5 Combustion device components on liquid rocket engines operate in extreme environments that challenge the functional design, materials, and fabrication as part of an engine system.
These components include combustion chambers, nozzles, injectors, gas generators, and igniter systems.
Each of these components serves different functions but have some commonality in requirements.
They must endure high pressure propellants, high temperature, and high pressure gases, while maintaining positive structural margins but low mass as part of the engine system and launch vehicle.
Component structures used in LREs can require very thin walls, in regeneratively-cooled nozzles for instance, that provide challenges for materials to sustain high thermal and structural loads.
Additionally, combining the environment with liquid and gaseous hydrogen propellant to the thermal and structural loads leads to an even more complex challenge.
For these applications, materials must be designed to resist Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE).2–4 Further- more, these components also have other key requirements to consider for materials selection, including mechanical strength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF), and thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity.2–3 The regeneratively-cooled, or channel-cooled nozzle, is a key component in various engine systems that expands combustion gases and increases the exhaust gas velocity.
The cooled nozzle is often the largest structure on the liquid rocket engine but must maintain small internal channels for proper cooling of the hot-wall to maintain adequate structural margins.
The design is balanced among extreme temperature environments, high pressure fluids, and structural loads from pres- sure, thrust, and sideloads during startup and shutdown.
A common heritage design for regenera- tively-cooled nozzles is the use of brazed tubes, but this technique presents challenges in the lead time and number of piece-parts, tube-stacking and assembly operations, brazing, and tooling.6 The manufacturing of large channel wall nozzles have been explored using various technologies including hot isostatic pressing (HIP) assisted brazing, laser welding, plating, and laser wire direct closeout.7,8 the use of AM and advanced manu- facturing techniques to solve some of the traditional manufacturing challenges for combustion chambers and nozzles.9–13 Many of these techniques focus on the reduction in cost and schedule for fabrication but have also put an emphasis on increasing the scale, specifically AM processes.
The laser powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) process uses concentrated thermal energy, achieved with a laser, to fuse metals by melting locally as the material is injected into a meltpool.3 This process allows for freeform fabrication of components or addition of material to components for the purposes of coating, repair, or modification using local deposition.
Freeform components are formed by the precise control of toolpath parameters created from a CAD model that creates individual (weld) beads that are deposited to take a final geometric shape.
LP-DED uses powder feedstock as the filler material and a laser as the energy source.
The powder and laser optics are mounted on an integrated deposition head, which allows for the convergence of the laser and powder at a defined focus at the surface of the substrate where material is melted and cooled to form the bead.
The build substrate can be a sacrificial build plate or an existing component.
The deposition head is mounted to a robotic arm or gantry system to control the motion through programmed or logic tool paths to deposit material or create features.
An example of the process can be seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1.
Material being deposited using LP-DED.3 Images used with permissions from: (Left) Addup, and (Right) Formalloy.
The LP-DED processed eat treatment steps to attain the material’s properties that are desirable for the application.
These steps often include a stress relief, homogenization, solution anneal, and aging treatment for precipitation hardened alloys.2–4 An effective stress relief mitigates residual stresses built up in the part during the LP- DED process and minimizes the potential distortions.
The second step, homogenization, is a common treatment for AM materials to reduce elemental segregation and promote recrystalliza- tion to achieve a more equiaxed grain structure in the material.
The third step, solution treatment, brings the part to a solid solution temperature to dissolve undesirable η-phase that forms during cooling from homogenization treatment, and then is rapidly cooled to maintain η-phase free solid solution.
Finally, the aging treatment promotes the precipitation of the strengthening phase in the alloy, the γ′ phase for s to consider for LRE nozzle material selection, including mechanical strength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF), and thermal conductivity.3 These five material properties are all interrelated and must be taken into consideration when optimizing the alloy composition and heat treatment for the LP-DED addresses the development of LP-DED omposition and heat treatment to obtain an optimum balance of key material properties for liquid rocket engine applications.
To date, the composition of use with the LP-DED technique.
The PHACOMP method was applied to guide com- position modification in order to obtain an optimum balance of the five key material properties.3 Improved homogenization and 2-step aging treatments were also developed to reduce Ti segrega- tion to an acceptable level that is essential for mitigation of η-phase precipitation at grain bound- aries.
There were many observations and lessons learned from the development of LP-DED on modification and heat treatment optimization enable high quality e LP-DED technique.
The improved chemical and microstructural homogeneities make LP-DED higher resistance to LCF in high pressure hydrogen environment, which is vital for the success and safety of LRE nozzles.

2.2 Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) was used to analyze the melting-solidification behav- ior of LP-DED ly developed at o increase strength and ductility in high-pressure hydrogen envi- ronments.
DTA analyses were performed using virgin a Netzsch STA 409CD thermal analyzer.
The atmosphere was high purity Ar gas and an A O empty crucible was used as the reference sample.
Samples were heated from room tempera- 2 3 ture to 1550 °C at 10 °C/min, and cooling was also performed using the same rate.
The endother- mic peaks indicate melting reaction, while exothermic peaks signify solidification reaction.
The DTA effort aims at obtaining a better understanding of melting and solidification characteristics of LP-DED tion, parts require post-processing heat treatment to attain the desirable mate- rials properties.
For LP-DED clude a stress relief, homogenization, solution anneal, and aging treatment.
The as-built samples received stress-relief treatment at 1950 °F/1.5h with a slow furnace cool.
After stress relief, the samples were subjected to a homogenization treatment at 2125 °F/6h in a vacuum furnace.
At the end of homogenization treatment, the samples were Ar quenched to minimize η-phase precipitation.
Then, the samples were solution annealed at 1950 °F/1h in vacuum with an Ar quench and followed by aging at 1325 °F/16h or 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h in vacuum to complete the heat treatment process.
2.4 Metallography and SEM analysis Selected LP-DED racterized after heat treatment and mechanical testing.
Specimens were sectioned, mounted, ground, and polished using standard metallographic procedures with a series of 220-2,000 grit paper and 3 µm diamond suspension – 0.05 µm alumina pads.
Chemical etching was conducted with waterless Kaling’s reagent immersed for 5–10 seconds.

High resolution optical montage images were taken to document the micro- structure for the entire sample.
Elemental analysis was conducted using EDS line scans at 15 kV and 0.5 µm between spectra.
Investigation of titanium segregation was carried out using an EDS detector attached to an SEM.
For as-deposited samples, EDS line scans were performed across the solidification structure that has a minimum distance of 250 µm to reveal the concentration profile of titanium.
For heat treated samples, the EDS line scans were greater than 250 µm and across at least one grain (two grain boundaries) to see the fluctuation of titanium concentration between grain boundaries and grain interior.
Homogenization kinetic calculations were performed to determine the titanium concentration distribution between grain boundaries as a function of homogenization tempera- ture, time and grain size.
2.5 Mechanical Testing Initial tensile testing was performed in ambient air with a strain rate of 0.5 in/in/min at three different temperatures, –320 °F, room temperature, and 1200 °F.
Elevated temperature ten- sile testing was conducted using a Mayes elevated temperature extensometer (Model: R3/8 Block 2) on a Instron load frame equipped with a 250 kN load cell according to guidelines established in ASTM E21, Standard Test Methods for Elevated Temperature Tension Tests of Metallic Materials.
Room temperature testing was conducted using an Instron 5582 load frame equipped with a 100 kN load cell and a Instron model 2620 extensometer according to guidelines established in ASTM E8, Standard Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials.
Tensile testing was also per- formed in 5 ksi high pressure gaseous helium (GHe) and gaseous hydrogen (GH ) environments at room temperature.
In 5 ksi GHe environment, the specimens were tensile tested at a strain rate of 0.02 in/in/min (in/in/min) until 2.0% elongation; then the strain rate was increased to 0.05 in/in/ min to failure.
In 5 ksi GH environment, tensile testing was conducted at a very slow strain rate of 0.0001 in/in/min until failure.
The slower strain rate was intended to closely gauge the HEE sus- ceptibility, which generally increases with decreasing strain rates.
Geometry of the smooth tensile specimen used for testing in 5 ksi GHe and GH environments at ambient temperature is shown in Figure 4.
Final machining of the gauge section was performed by turning and the specified surface finish for the gauge section was 32 µin.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 3.1 Melting and solidification characteristics DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis) can precisely determine solids/liquids temperatures and detect precipitate formation/dissolution reactions for an alloy in a timely fashion without laborious heat treating and metallographic analysis.
In addition, DTA can compare alloy solidifi- cation temperature range (STR) and volume fraction of terminal eutectic phase that can provide insights into weldability and printability in additive manufacturing.

During the cooling cycle, there is a distinct solidification peak at 2446 °F (on-cooling solidus) and a smaller peak that represents terminal liquid solidification at 2370 °F.

The melting and solidification characteristics of LP-DED JBK-75 are similar to that of the as-built LP-DED has one distinct endothermic peak that represents the on-heating liquidus at 2554 °F.
During the cooling cycle, there is a distinct solidification peak at 2511 °F (on- cooling solidus) and a very shallow peak that represents terminal liquid solidification at 2358 °F.

Overall, these two alloys exhibit similar melting and solidification behavior.
One notable difference between these two alloys is the solidification temperature range (STR), which is 151 °F for LP-DED ure 9 compares the terminal liquid solidification peaks for LP-DED rials exhibit a eutectic-terminal liquid solidification peak that occurs at 2358 – 2370 °F.

In terms of metallurgical factors, the STR as well as the amount and distribution of the terminal liquid are the primary factors that affect the susceptibility of solidification cracking in Ni-base alloys.
The solidification temperature range controls the size of semi-solid crack susceptible region that surrounds the liquid weld pool.
A narrow STR is preferred as a relatively wider STR will produce a larger semi-solid crack susceptible region, thus increasing the weld cracking susceptibility.13 )gm/Vu(/TΔ Table 3.

Solidification behavior analysis for (a) as-built LP-DED P-DED d solidifica- tion peak at around 2370° F. In many alloys, cracks can form during the terminal stages of solidification when liquid films are distributed along the grain boundaries and, in some cases, interdendritic sites.
At this stage, shrinkage strains across the partially solidified boundaries can become appreciable.
For a given alloy system, the solidification temperature range and amount of terminal liquid are controlled primarily by chemical composition.
The amount of terminal liquid is the product of a eutectic reaction that occurs at the end of solidification.
This eutectic reaction occurs at a lower temperature than the alloy solidus and expands the solidification temperature range, making the alloy more susceptible to solidification cracking.
However, when the amount of terminal liquid is high, it can often flow back into the cracks and provide a ‘crack healing’ effect.
It is generally recognized that the backfilling of solidification cracks by the terminal eutectic liquid can reduce )gm/Vu(/TΔ )gm/Vu(/TΔ or eliminate solidification cracking, particularly at low restraint level.14 When the effects of microstructure are not taken into consideration, the DTA results suggest LP-DED bility to that of LP-DED JBK-75.
hen fabricating components using LP- DED and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) techniques.
Metal additive manufacturing (such as LP-DED and L-PBF) is fundamentally a repeated welding process, where the layer-by-layer growth of the component is achieved through local melting of metal powder by a laser energy source.
Although the metallic AM process results in solidification cooling rates that are far higher than those seen in more traditional welding processes, the existing weldability and weld crack- ing susceptibility theories can still be applied for AM materials.
Candidate materials for AM should be weldable alloys that are less susceptible to cracking that originates in the liquid phase, such as solidification cracking and liquation cracking.
AM alloys should also have good resis- tance to solid-state cracking phenomenon that occurs due to stresses build-up at temperatures slightly below the solidus temperature, such as strain-age cracking and ductility-dip cracking.

3.2 Microstructure Evolution 3.2.1 Microstructure of As-Built LP-DED section microstructure of an as-built 3.175 mm thick LP- DED panel.
This panel was deposited at a laser power of 1070 watts with a single pass per layer that are parallel to the previous layer.
The melt pool boundary is readily apparent in the as built material.
The columnar dendrites, which are common in as-built LP-DED materials, are shown in greater detail in Figure 10(b).
In the high energy LP-DED process, the melt pools are cooled rap- idly and the growing grains (and dendrites) align themselves with the temperature gradients and result in columnar structure morphology.16 The dendrites exhibit a pattern of formation from the outer perimeter of the melt pool toward a central point in single-pass LP-DED ovides favorable conditions for epitaxial dendrite (grain) growth.
As a result, the dendrites in the new layers are formed with the same orientation as the previous lay- ers through several melt pools.
The dendrites are somewhat randomly oriented near the melt pool periphery (toward the panel outer surface) likely due to the complex temperature gradient from the melt pool to the surrounding material.
A close-up view of the dendritic structure in an as-built single-pass LP-DED ize of dendrite cell is very small and the dendritic arm spacing is in most cases smaller than 25 µm.
Solute rejection of tita- nium to the interdendritic regions on solidification leads to the preferential attack upon etching.
As a result, the existence of titanium segregation is revealed as the dark spots in the interdendritic regions.3 (a) (b) Figure 10.

3.2.2 Microstructure Evolution after Stress Relief and Homogenization Figure 12 illustrates the microstructures of single-pass LP-DED s relief treatments.
These panels were deposited at a laser power of 1070 watts with a single pass per layer that are parallel to the previous layer.
The sample that received stress relief treatment at 1700 °F exhibits dominant dendritic structure similar to that of the as-built material.
The dendritic morphologies were significantly weakened with increasing the stress relief temperature.
Significant microstructure changes occurred when the stress relief temperature rose to 1800 °F.
The dendritic structure has almost vanished, and the early stage of recrystallization has occurred after being heat treated at 1800 °F/1.5h.
Stress relief at 1900 °F/1.5h led to a slightly higher degree of recrystallization but the grain structure remains very heterogeneous (see Figure 12(d)).
During the LP-DED process, the rapid heating and cooling of the melt pools along with the molten metal volume change upon solidification result in buildup of residual stress in the parts.
The driving force for recrystallization is the residual stress from the additive manufacturing pro- cess.17–19 It is apparent that the residual stress for single-pass LP-DED allization occurs when the stress relief temperature is higher than 1800 °F.
(a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 12.

These single-pass LP-DED panel was depos- ited at a laser power of 1070 watts with a thickness of approximately 3.175 mm.
After stress relief at 1800 °F/1.5h, the panel samples were subjected to a homogenization cycle of 2125 °F/3h.
It is obvious that a high degree of recrystallization and grain growth had taken place after the homogenization treatment as shown in Figure 13.
The grain size is quite large and many grains in the material are larger than 250 µm in diameter.
The large grain structure can be attributed to the large melt pool dimensions in these single-pass LP-DED panels.
It is worth noting that the homogenized sample displays smaller grains near the surface and larger grains toward the center regions.
The uneven grain size distribution is caused by faster melt pool cool- ing rate at the part periphery than in the part center during the LP-DED process.
Precipitation of the undesirable brittle η-phase (Ni Ti) is very sensitive to the cooling rates after homogenization treatment.
Upon the completion of the homogenization treatment, the samples were cooled rap- idly through Ar quench method to mitigate precipitation of η-phase (Fig.
13).
The as-homogenized sample appears free of η-phase.

3.2.3 Precipitation of Grain Boundary η-phase after Aging strengthened superalloy.
The matrix phase, γ, is a solid solution of Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mo, and W, whereas the precipitate phase γ′ is associated with the hardening elements, Ti and Al.
In addition, η phase has been observed in the microstruc- ture.
η phase is a Ti rich acicular precipitate that generally forms at grain boundaries but does form within the grains with prolonged exposure at elevated temperatures.
After homogeniza- tion treatment, the samples were solution annealed at 1800 °F/1h, followed by argon quenching.
These samples were then aged at 1325 °F/16h to complete the heat treatment process for LP-DED rostructure appears η-phase free after solution anneal.
The parts were cooled rapidly from 1800 °F to ambient temperature by quenching in water to maintain η-phase free solid solution.
However, precipitation of η-phase at grain boundaries occurred after the standard aging treatment at 1325°F/16h as shown in Figure 14(b).
It is postu- lated that dissolution of η phase had taken place at 1800 °F but Ti concentration at grain bound- aries remained quite high.
As a result, copious η phase precipitated along some grain boundaries after aging at 1325 °F/16h.

The η-phase in the 3.175 mm thick LP-DED panel has pref- erentially formed near the edges where the difference in grain size was observed, but it was seen to a lesser degree in the middle of panel sample after aging.
However, grain-boundary η-phase is more evenly distributed through thickness in a thin single-pass (1 mm thick) LP-DED nt at 1325 °F/16h (see Fig.
16).
The 1 mm thick single-pass LP-DED panel was deposited at a laser power of 350 watts.
It is not clear as to what causes the uneven grain boundary η phase distribution in the 3.15 mm single-pass LP-DED panel.

LP-DED t is not seen in wrought can be attributed to the difference in the solidifi- cation rates between LP-DED and casting processes.
For Fe-Ni-based superalloys, the prevalent nucleation sites for η-phase during aging treatment are the grain boundaries because η-phase has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure that is non-coherent with the matrix.20 The presence of grain-boundary η phase (Ni Ti) in fully heat-treated LP-DED s η-phase is brittle and has a negative impact on tensile ductility, LCF life, and HEE resistance.
For LP-DED n-boundary η-phase can be mitigated by optimization of (1) chemical composition and (2) heat treatment.
In general, the for- mation of ·η-phase is strongly related to (1) Ti/Al ratio, (2) Ti content, and (3) alloy composition.21 When Ti/Al ratio is high, the Ti-rich γ′ can transform to the η-phase during aging.
Moreover, the volume fraction of η-phase generally increases with a greater Ti/Al ratio.
In contrast, in an alloy with higher Ti content, the η-phase can easily form with a lower Ti/Al ratio.
This indicates that both Ti/Al ratio and Ti content must be tailored to mitigate the formation of η-phase.
Further- more, mitigation of η-phase precipitation can be accomplished through heat treatment modifica- tion to reduce Ti segregation and retard γ′ to η-phase transformation.4 In addition to mitigating η precipitation to improve HEE resistance, the chemistry and heat treatment optimization efforts were also directed toward obtaining an optimal balance of the primary material properties (such as tensile strength, low cycle fatigue, and ductility) for LRE applications.
3.3 Obtaining an Optimal Balance of Five Important Material Properties Liquid rocket engines operate in extreme and challenging environments in which the temperature can range from that of liquid hydrogen (–423 °F) to 6000 °F hot gas.22 Component structures used in LREs require very thin walls in regeneratively-cooled nozzles that place great demands on materials selection as the structures must be able to endure enormous thermal shock during transients and large temperature differentials across walls during engine operation.
Addi- tionally, combining the environment with liquid and gaseous hydrogen propellant to the thermal and structural loads provides an even more complex challenge.
For these applications, materials must be designed to resist Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE).
In addition, there are also other key requirements to consider for LRE structural material selection, including tensile strength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF) resistance, and thermal conductivity.3 The importance of the key properties is shown below: (1) Mechanical Strength – During the operation of LRE, the nozzle or chamber wall is subjected to high thermal load induced by huge temperature difference across the wall and the mechanical load caused by the pressure difference between the coolant-side wall and the hot-gas- side wall.23–25 Yielding is expected as localized stress would be beyond the elastic limit and inelas- tic strain will accumulate in the plastically deformed regions.
High strength is required so that the materials have sufficient mechanical strength margin to support the thermal and mechanical loads in the components.
(2) Ductility – Due to the high thermal and mechanical loads on the components, the stress of LRE nozzles would be beyond the elastic limit, and severe plastic strains accumulate in the inner wall.23 Cyclic plastic strain accumulates in the inner wall during multiple operations, which is known as thermal ratcheting.25 Therefore, having high ductility is essential to prevent component failure caused by cyclic accumulation of plastic strain in the inner wall.24 (3) Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) – Good resistance to low cycle fatigue (LCF) is essential for LRE nozzles as LCF is one of the most predominant failure modes.24–25 During the cyclic operation of ambient temperatures (or sometimes chilling), transient startup, steady state, shut down transient, post-cooling and relaxation, the elastic-plastic deformation of channel wall nozzle induced by the synergy of high-speed hot gas and high-pressure cryogenic coolant results in residual strain.
After many work cycles, the residual strain can accumulate to an extent that cracks begin to initiate in the cooling channels (typically in the hotwall, which has the highest strains).
Hence, LCF is the primary service life limiting factor of regenerative cooling channel wall nozzles.25 (4) Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE) – Due to the use of high-pressure liquid hydrogen as propellant for some LREs, the selected LRE nozzle materials must resist Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE).
The high-pressure liquid hydrogen coolant that enters the cooling channels absorbs heat and maintains wall temperatures low enough to prevent melting.
The liquid hydrogen coolant warms up and gasifies, creating high pressure gaseous hydrogen envi- ronment in the cooling channels.
HEE effects will become more pronounced when the channel inner hotwall temperature is between –100 °C to 100 °C.26 Therefore, having excellent resistance to HEE is one of the most important material selection criteria for LRE nozzle materials that oper- ate in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment.
(5) Thermal Conductivity – The nozzle wall is subjected to high heat flux from the combus- tion gases.
To protect the nozzle wall, regenerative cooling must be applied by flowing a cryogenic liquid (or sometimes gaseous) propellant into the nozzle cooling channels to prevent the nozzle from melting.
Therefore, nozzle materials must have high thermal conductivity to improve the cooling efficiency of cryogenic propellant and lower the nozzle temperature and thermal strain.23 These five key properties are all interrelated and must be taken into consideration when optimizing the formulation and heat treatment for LP-DED have issues with ductility, low cycle fatigue, and fracture toughness.
After conducting a thorough assessment, it was determined that the most appropriate way to obtain an optimal compromise of the five important material properties is through a moderate strength reduction as shown in Figure 17.
A moderate 10 – 15% strength reduction is expected to increase ductility, LCF life, and maintain good HEE resistance and thermal conductivity.
To date, an optimal comprise of these five important material properties has been accomplished through optimization of alloy chemistry and heat treatment.

3.3.1 Alloy Chemistry Optimization The development of many historical superalloys was accomplished primarily by tedious trial-and-error approach.27 Phase prediction using simple binary or ternary phase diagrams was not a viable option due to the complex nature of the highly alloyed superalloys and lack of com- putational tools at the time.
A modern analytical tool that can be used to predict microstruc- ture stability and formation of deleterious phases in superalloys is PHACOMP, which stands for PHAse COMPutation.
PHACOMP was developed by Morinaga et al.
to predict austenite phase (γ) stability vs TCP or GCP phase formation in Ni-base, Co-base and Fe-base alloys.28–33 The PHACOMP concept was devised based on molecular orbital calculation (the discrete variational (DX)-Xα cluster method) for transition-metal-based alloys.
TCP stands for topologically-closed- pack intermetallic phases (e.g.
σ, χ, and Laves phases), and GCP stands for geometrically closed- pack intermetallic phases (e.g.
η, δ phases).34 PHACOMP was successfully applied to control the formation of GCP phases, such as η phase, for the development of high-entropy alloys.35 In brief, the PHACOMP method offers new approaches to advance the alloy design by estimating the solid solubility in superalloys to control the formation of undesirable TCP/GCP phases.
PHACOMP uses a parameter, Md, which is an average d-electron energy above the Fermi energy level of alloying transition metals, to estimate the solid solubility of FCC (Face Centered Cubic) γ matrix.
Overall, the alloy chemistry optimization for LP-DED Md level was kept close to that of JBK-75 to increase stability of the γ (austenitic) matrix that is essential to mitigate η-phase formation.
• Ni and Fe form the matrix of FCC γ phase, which acts as base or solvent for other elements in the alloy.
A slight increase in Fe helps to depress Md.
The Fe:Ni ratio was increased slightly to maintain high resistance to HEE.36 • Co was increased slightly to reduce Md.
Co offers solid solution strengthening and can also increase the solid solubility for the γ′ forming elements (Ti, Al) and retard η-phase formation.
• Cr was reduced slightly to reduce Md.
Cr is mainly present in γ matrix and is a potent solid- solution strengthener.
Cr promotes formation of the protective Cr O oxide layer that gives the 2 3 alloy its hot corrosion resistance.
• W is an important refractory element that provides persistent solid-solution strengthening at elevated temperatures.
W was reduced slightly to bring Md to a lower level.
In ed to provide adequate resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.
Addition of W drastically reduces the stacking fault energy (SFE) of superalloys, which has been shown to decrease the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement for several binary transi- tion metal alloys.37 • Mo was reduced slightly to bring Md to a lower level.
Similar to W, Mo is also a refractory element that provides persistent solid-solution strengthening at elevated temperatures.
A slight reduction in both Mo and W contents would reduce strength and improve ductility and LCF resistance.
• Ti and Al serve as the basis for the strengthening mechanism in Fe-Ni-base Superalloys as they combine with Ni to form the strengthening γ′ precipitate (Ni (Ti,Al)).
Ti content and Ti/ Al ratio were slightly reduced to mitigate η-phase formation and to obtain an optimal compro- mise of the five material properties through a moderate strength reduction.
In PHACOMP analysis, Md, which is an average d-electron energy above the Fermi energy level is calculated from the alloy composition.
The Md values for various commonly used transi- tion alloying elements in fcc Ni are listed in Table 4.
Al and Si are non-transition metals and their Md values are empirically determined from interpolation of the curve of Md versus the metallic radius.38 Table 4.

(1) where 𝑀𝑀 𝑛𝑛 𝑀𝑀 𝑛𝑛 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 Xi (Md)i ∑ Md = average Md parameter Xi = the atomic fraction of the element i in the γ matrix n = the number of elements in the alloy (Md)i = the Md value for element i The summation is taken over all the alloying elements, i=1,2…n.
For simplicity, the unit of Md parameter, eV, is omitted in this paper.
When Md increases beyond a critical value, the Md method assumes that the phase instability will occur and a secondary phase will appear in a terminal solid solution.
In other words, the critical Md determines the solubility limit of γ matrix.
This Md Equation can be expressed empirically based on the atomic concentration of the alloy- ing elements in the overall alloy composition.
For example, the Md value for the final formulation (previously named Revision 3) LP-DED ) × X (Fe atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Ni atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Cr Fe Fe Ni Ni Cr Cr atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Mo atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (V atomic fraction) + Mo Mo V V (Md) × X (W atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Co atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Ti W W Co Co Ti Ti atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Al atomic fraction) Al Al = 0.858 × 0.4204 (Fe at%) + 0.717 × 0.3300 (Ni at%) + 1.142 × 0.1600 (Cr at%) + 1.55 × 0.0107 (Mo at%) + 1.543 × 0.0034 (V at%) + 1.655 × 0.0050 (W at%) + 0.777 × 0.0367 (Co at%) + 2.271 × 0.0268 (Ti at%) + 1.900 × 0.0053 (Al at%) = 0.9134 Similar calculations were performed for other alloys to yield the Md values.
PHACOMP can determine a critical Md value, above which microstructure instability occurs.
Currently, the critical Md value that must be kept below to avoid η-phase formation for 86 and JBK-75 can be kept to a very low level after heat treatment, the Md levels of A-286 and JBK-75 were used as the estimated critical threshold value for LP-DED ED 86 and JBK-75 to improve the γ matrix stability.
Another important consideration for the LP- DED cellent HEE resistance should not be altered.
Based on the above approaches, the chemical composition for LP-DED le 5.

Due to the reduction in Md value, LP-DED ave better micro- structure stability than the initial formulation.
Figure 18 compares the Md values for the alloys listed in Table 5.

The reduction of Ti content and the overall M value is expected to retard precipitation of undesirable d grain boundary η-phase and achieve an optimal balance of the primary material properties for LRE applications.

)ve( leveL dM 3.3.2 Heat Treatment Optimization During metal additive manufacturing (AM) process, the material is deposited layer by layer by a high-power laser beam and is subjected to a complex thermal cycle that includes rapid heating above the melting temperature and rapid cooling and solidification of the molten material.
Thus, the AM material often has heterogeneous microstructures, and non-uniform chemical composition and phase distribution.2–3 These characteristics make it difficult to produce AM parts with materials properties and microstructures that are as reproducible as same alloys produced by conventional wrought process.
Once the composition of wrought using the PHACOMP method, attention was directed toward heat treatment optimization.
The as-deposited LP-DED egation in the interdendritic regions.
Titanium segregation promotes precipitation of η-phase (Ni Ti) at grain boundaries that is detrimental to tensile ductility, LCF life, and resistance to hydrogen environment embrittlement.
Therefore, a new heat treatment was developed to minimize titanium segregation and η-phase precipitation for LP-DED an was put together based on the homogenization kinetic analysis as shown in Table 6.
A higher temperature stress relief at 1950 °F was attempted to understand the effects of stress relief temperature on grain structure evolution.
Homogenization treatment was extended for times up to 12 hours at 2125 °F.
It is a great concern that the standard solution anneal temperature of 1800 °F was too close to the upper boundary of the η-phase TTP diagram.39 Therefore, higher solution anneal temperature was also attempted at 1950 °F to ensure η-phase is completely dissolved and Ti concentration at grain boundary is reduced to a very low level prior to the final aging treatment.

Stress relief treatment is intended to relieve internal residual stress and strain energy and must be performed at an elevated temperature that can activate the recovery process.
During stress relief treatment, atomic diffu- sion takes place and atoms in regions of high stress move to regions of lower stress.
Significant microstructure changes occur when the stress relief temperature exceeds 1800 °F.
Recrystalliza- tion during stress relief is desirable for LP-DED 7 columnar dendritic structure to finer and more equiaxed grain structure.
Varying degree of recrys- tallization occurred when the material was heat treated at 2125 °F after stress relief.
As shown in Figure 19, the grain structure evolution after HIP (2125 °F/3h + furnace cooling) is sensitive to the stress relief temperature.
The grain structure is finest for the samples that received stress relief treatment at 1900 °F/1.5h.
It is apparent that higher stress relief temperature prior to HIP promotes recrystallization and decreases grain size.
Similar grain size reduction was accomplished when LP- DED h and followed by a homogenization treatment at 2125 °F/3h.
40 One of the most important effects of post-processing heat treatment for AM mate- rials is microstructure refinement.
It is desirable to have finer and more equiaxed grain structure.
Therefore, 1950 °F/1.5h was chosen as the stress relief treatment for LP-DED (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) Figure 19.
Varying degree of recrystallization occurred when the material was HIPed at 2125 °F after stress relief.
These samples were stress relieved at 1700 °F for (a) and (b), 1800 °F for (c) and (d), 1900 °F for (e) and (f) before HIP.
3.3.2.2 Reduction of Ti Segregation through Homogenization.
One of the most important considerations for post-processing heat treatment is the control of grain structure.
It is desirable to have finer and more equiaxed grain structure.
Stress relief causes recovery and some degree of recrystallization.
Variation in grain structure evolution after stress relief results from the com- petition between the recovery process and the concurrent recrystallization.
The driving force for recrystallization is the thermal residual stresses that are introduced from the LP-DED process.
Lower temperature stress relief extended the recovery process and reduced the driving force for recrystallization.
Higher stress relief temperature promotes recrystallization and suppresses the recovery process.
When the stress relief temperature is increased to 1900 °F and above, recovery process is largely suppressed, and the number of active recrystallization nuclei increases, leading to smaller and more equiaxed grain structure after homogenization treatment at 2125 °F.
Finer, more equiaxed and more evenly distributed grain structure can improve overall mechanical prop- erties, reducing the anisotropy in mechanical properties.
Therefore, selecting an optimal combi- nation of stress relief and homogenization treatments to minimize recovery process and promote recrystallization is a significant method to consider for LP-DED evolution in LP-DED -processing homogenization has been investigated in detail.4 It was found that tita- nium segregation migrates from the interdendritic regions (in as-built LP-DED material) to grain boundaries after homogenization treatment.
A basic model for titanium diffusion in tion distribution of titanium as a function of homogenization temperature, duration, and grain size.
The results of the homogenization kinetic analysis provide a valuable reference on how the homogenization treatment should be adjusted for LP-DED n alloy can be calculated by the value of residual segre- gation index, δ as shown below.4 δ – π (2) C𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−C𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚 Dt (C0𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−C0𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 L C and C represent the grain-boundary solute atom concentration (highest 0max 0min concentration) and the grain center solute atom concentration (lowest concentration) before the start of homogenization.
C and C are the grain-boundary solute atom concentration and max min the grain center solute atom concentration after performing the homogenization treatment for a duration, t. D is the diffusion coefficient of Ti in the matrix, and L is half wavelength of Ti concentration (segregation).
The time required to reach the desired homogenization level (or the residual segregation index, δ) can be expressed as the Equation below:4 δ (3) π2 L ln 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 Do – 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 D is the diffusion constant (m2/s), Q is the diffusion activation energy (J/mole), R is the o gas constant (8.31 J/mole-K), and T is the thermodynamic temperature (°K).
It is significant to note that a two-fold decrease in the segregation wavelength (L, equivalent to half of the grain diameter) would result in a four-fold decrease in the homogenization time (t).
The homogenization process for LP-DED of Ti atoms from a higher concentration location at grain boundaries to the lower concentration location at grain center.
Figure 20 shows the predicted homogenization kinetics (Ti diffusion) for LP-DED index (δ) of 0.1.
It can be clearly seen that homogeniza- tion time decreases with an increase of homogenization temperature for the same grain size.
Small grain size (lower L value) has a great advantage in achieving homogeneous microstruc- ture in shorter time than that in large grain material.
The standard homogenization treatment for LP-DED mogenization kinetics curves, to reach the target residual segregation index (δ) of 0.1, the combinations of temperature and time are 2125 °F / 5.3h and 2125 °F / 14.8h for grain size of 60 µm (L = 30 µm) and 100 µm (L = 50 µm), respectively.
Based on the homogenization kinetic analysis, it is apparent that homogenization at 2125 °F/3h was not adequate for LP-DED r than 100 µm in diameter).

A large variation in Ti concentration can be clearly seen over a 1200 µm distance.
The nominal 2.5 wt% Ti varies consid- erably between a minimum of 0.0% to a maximum of about 10%.
A close-up view for Ti concen- tration up 8% (Fig.

)%tw( iT )%tw( noitartnecnoC iT Ti segregation amplitude can be greatly reduced by increasing the homogenization time at 2125 °F.
Figure 22 shows Ti concentration profile in 1mm thick single-pass LP-DED 125 °F for 3, 6, and 12 hours.
As shown in Figure 22(a), the fluctuation of Ti concentration amplitude was reduced from 0.3 – 8% (in the as-built condi- tion) to approximately 1.0 – 4.5% after homogenization at 2125 °F/3h.
Ti concentration is still significantly higher than the nominal 2.5 wt% in many locations.
An increase of the homogeniza- tion time to 6 hours leads to noticeable improvement in Ti segregation as shown in Figure 22(b).
After homogenization at 2125 °F/6h, titanium segregation amplitude decreased further and most Ti peaks fluctuated in the range of 1.0 – 3.5%.
However, further increase of the homogenization time to 12 hours leads to only marginal improvement in Ti segregation amplitude as shown in Figure 22(c).
The EDS line scan results clearly indicate the standard homogenization treatment at 2125 °F/3h is not adequate to reduce titanium segregation to an acceptable level for LP-DED in LP-DED or longer duration should be performed in order to reduce Ti segregation to a very low level.4 However, the use of a temperature higher than 2125 °F is not be recommended due to the increased risks of surface oxidation, grain growth and potential growth of internal pores.
Performing a homogenization treatment at 2125 °F for durations longer than 12 hours cannot be justified either as reduction of Ti segregation becomes very sluggish after the initial 6 hours at 2125 °F.

ation treatment at elevated temperatures for 24 hours, which is significantly longer than the recommended 2125 °F/6h for LP-DED geneity in wrought ow level by thermo-mechanical processes such as hot rolling and forging.
Thus, extended homogenization treatment coupled with thermo-mechanical process drastically reduced Ti segregation and the propensity to form the detrimental η-phase at grain boundary in LP-DED cipitation through Solution Anneal and Aging.
After homogenization, solution anneal and aging processes are performed sequentially to precipitate and grow the strengthening γ′ precipitate (Ni (Ti,Al)).
al and solution anneal should be performed above the η-phase solvus temperature to dissolve the undesirable η-phase that forms during cooling from homogenization treatment.
The standard solution anneal for LP-DED ximately 50 °F above the η-phase solvus temperature.39 Therefore, solution anneal temperature was increased to 1950 °F to ensure complete dissolution of η-phase, followed by a quench.
Another advantage of conducting SA at 1950 °F is that Ti segregation amplitude can be slightly reduced according to the homogenization kinetic analysis.4 The standard aging treatment for wrought that the standard single-step aging treatment at 1325 °F/16h was unable to reduce the precipitation of brittle η-phase (Ni Ti) to an acceptable level for LP-DED of localized Ti segregation.
Figure 23 shows precipitation of η-phase at grain boundar- ies when aging treatment was performed at 1325 °F, 1300 °F, and 1275 °F.
Grain boundaries are η-phase free after solution anneal at 1800 °F/1h as shown in Figure 23 (a).
Abundant η-phase pre- cipitated at grain boundaries after aging at 1325 °F/24h.
The volume fraction of grain-boundary η-phase decreases significantly when the aging temperature was lowered to 1300 °F (Fig.
23 (c)).
Only a few isolated η-phase was present at grain boundaries after aging at 1275 °F/16h (Fig.
23 (d)).
It is apparent that the amount of grain-boundary η-phase decreases with a reduction in aging temperature.
Therefore, 1275 °F was selected as the 1st step aging temperature.

Lowering the aging temperature to 1275 °F is expected to slow down the kinetics of γ′ precipitation and result in a significant reduction in tensile strength.
In order to keep the strength reduction within a moderate 10 – 15% range, the standard single-step aging treatment must be modified into a 2-step aging process.
Two-step aging treatment is commonly used for age-harden- able superalloys to maximize strength and to develop the best combination of short-term tensile and long-term creep properties.41 In γ′-strengthened superalloys, the 1st aging treatment (higher temperature) precipitates secondary γ′ precipitates and finer secondary or tertiary γ′ precipitates during the 2nd step aging (lower temperature).42,43 The most important mechanism of η-phase pre- cipitation during aging treatment is γ′→ η transformation.
The 2-step aging treatment is specifi- cally designed to improve the microstructure stability to retard γ′→ η transformation during aging treatment.
Two promising 2-step aging treatments, 1275 °F/16h + 1200 °F/16h and 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h, were selected for further evaluation through tensile testing.44 The most promising 2-step aging treatment would be chosen after performing an in-depth analysis on tensile data, which includes yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, ductility, and strain hardening exponent.
3.3.3 Effects of Heat Treatment on Tensile Properties To examine the impacts of heat treatments on mechanical properties, tensile tests were per- formed using LP-DED ition parameters that could be used to produce parts.
All samples were subjected to stress relief at 1800 °F/1.5h, homogeniza- tion treatment at 2125 °F/3h, and solution anneal at 1800 °F/1h, prior to aging treatment.
Four aging treatments were selected for tensile property evaluation as shown in Table 7.
The standard aging treatment for wrought baseline for compari- son with the other three aging treatments.
All tests were performed in air at room temperature with the as-deposited wall thickness and diameter shown in Table 7.
The most promising 2-step aging treatment was chosen after performing an in-depth analysis on tensile data, which includes yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, ductility, and strain hardening exponent n (σ = Kεn).
The strain hardening exponent can be determined by using the true stress-true strain curve obtained from a tensile test.
The Equation below describes the true stress-true strain correlation during the tensile testing: ο ε (4) Where σ is true stress, K is the strength coefficient, ε is true strain, and n is strain hardening expo- nent.
A simple power-curve relation can express the flow curve of many metals in the region of uniform plastic deformation, which is from yielding up to the maximum load.
The strain-harden- ing exponent is the slope of the true stress-true strain curve, when plotted on logarithmic coordi- nates (n = ∂lnσ/∂lnε).
A high strain hardening exponent enhances a materials ability to uniformly distribute the imposed plastic strain.
Table 7 summarizes the effects of aging treatment on room temperature tensile properties for LP-DED ar samples have an average yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture elongation of 87.02 – 109.60 ksi, 162.40 – 171.61 ksi, and 32.23 – 38.97%.
The 350W – 0.047” thick samples have an average yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture elongation in the range of 73.57 – 89.58 ksi, 142.37 – 147.61 ksi, and 25.32 – 30.97%.
The 0.047” thick single-pass samples, which have very large grain size, display excellent strain hardening exponent that are critical for LRE nozzle application.
It is encouraging to note that hin panels using the LP-DED method.
One 1070W – 0.6” diameter round bar sample that has the highest tensile strength was selected from each aging treatment to compare the strain hardening behavior.
Signs of high strain harden- ing capability are delayed necking, high elongation, and lower yield strength.
As shown in Figure 24, it is apparent that A4 2-step aging treatment, 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h (total time of 32 hours), yields higher strain hardening capability than the others.

One key takeaway from the tensile data analysis is A4 2-step aging treatment yields signifi- cantly higher tensile ductility and strain hardening exponent than the standard single-step aging treatment (1325 °F/16h).
The strain hardening exponent ranking is A4 > A2 > A3 > A1.
The mate- rial that has high strain hardening exponent can store more strain energy, diffuse deformation, and improve LCF performance.
Strain hardening behavior is microstructure dependent and the improved strain hardening capability with A4 2-step aging can be attributed to high solute con- tents and the presence of finer and underaged γ′ precipitate.
The solute contents in the alloy can enhance the efficiency of dislocation storage during plastic deformation and increase the level of strain hardening.
As nucleation and growth of γ′ precipitate consumes more free solutes, an oppo- site evolution trend of strain hardening (n) is observed.
Therefore, A4 (1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h) is the most promising and has been selected as the new aging treatment for LP-DED heat treatment for LP-DED t to the new heat treatment is given in Figure 25.

The evolution of post-processing heat treatment for LP-DED bits expected trends in tensile strength and ductil- ity as temperatures of aging cycles are reduced.
Changes from the standard single step aging cycle to a lower temperature two step aging cycle resulted in improved fracture elongation and strain hardening behavior, which is important for components that need excellent low cycle fatigue resis- tance.
LP-DED tensile strengths than the wrought alloy.
This strength reduction is part of the trade to optimizing the alloy for LRE applications.
However, ductility of LP-DED of the wrought alloy due to optimization of chemical composition and heat treatment.
LCF performance, which is the primary service life limit factor for LRE nozzles, is expected to increase to the same level of the wrought alloy.

Layer melt pool boundaries with different columnar den- dritic morphologies can be clearly seen in the as-built state.
The microstructure consists of recrys- tallized grains and annealed twins after heat treatment as shown in Figure 26(d).
The typical grain size varies from approximately 50 – 250 µm.
Grain boundaries look very clean as the undesirable grain-boundary η phase is reduced to a very low level with the new heat treatment.

Table 8 summarizes the tensile properties of LP-DED re from –320 °F to 1400 °F.
It can be seen from Table 8 that both YS and UTS decrease gradually with an increase in the test temperature from room temperature to 1200 °F.
UTS/YS ratio, and strain hardening exponent also decrease gradually as the test temperature increases up to 1200 °F.
Tensile fracture elongation is very high around 45 – 49% at –320 °F and decreases slightly to 35 – 41% at room temperature.
Tensile ductility remains quite high up to 1100 °F.
A significant reduction in ductility was noted when the testing temperature increased to 1200 °F and above.

The materials with FCC crystal lattice, such as pplications as they have more dislocation slip systems (12 systems) that can assist in plastic deformation and enhance ductil- ity in extremely cold condition.
Many FCC alloys exhibit higher strain hardening capability at cryogenic temperature because the internal energy of atoms is greatly reduced, which hampers the movement of dislocations.
Tensile fracture elongation is typically proportional to the value of strain hardening exponent (n) as high strain hardening capability can homogenize plastic deforma- tion and retard tensile fracture initiation.
Therefore, the improved ductility in cryogenic tempera- tures can be attributed to the enhanced strain hardening capability that makes deformation more homogeneous and stable prior to fracture.
The specimens aged with single-step aging cycle have higher strength but lower fracture elongation and strain hardening exponent.
On the other hand, the specimens that were subjected to two-step aging treatment exhibits lower strength but higher fracture elongation and strain hard- ening exponent.
Strain hardening exponent for LP-DED solid solution concentration of γ-matrix and the size and distribution of γ′ strengthening precipitate.
The concentration of Ti and Al in the γ-matrix solid solution in 2-step aged condition is higher than that in the 1-step aged condition because the material is significantly underaged after 2-step aging cycle.
The increase in strain hardening exponent can be attributed to higher sol- ute concentration (Ti and Al) in γ matrix and the presence of finer tertiary γ′ and more uniformly distributed secondary γ′ precipitate structure.
Higher Ti and Al concentration in γ-matrix enables the material to store more dislocations during tensile deformation and lead to enhanced strain hardening capability.
The engineering stress vs. strain curves of LP-DED e and 1200 °F were selected to compare strain hardening behavior as a function of tem- perature.
As shown in Figure 27, it is apparent that the flow stress and strain hardening behavior are strongly influenced by test temperature and aging cycles.
Serrated stress-strain flow behavior was observed for the 2-step aged samples tested at 1200 °F, which is indicative of dynamic strain aging (DSA).
The repeated locking and unlocking of dislocations create serrations in stress-strain curves, which is known as DSA.46 DSA is commonly seen in many Ni-based superalloys during tensile deformation at elevated temperatures.47 DSA generally occurs at a certain combination of temperature and strain rate, where the diffusivity of the solute atom is sufficient to obstruct the dislocation motion.
Serrations appear as a result of interaction of moving dislocations with the interstitial or substitutional alloying elements.
It is interesting to note that the 1-step aged sample does not appear to have serrated stress-strain flow behavior as shown in Figure 27(c).
The 2-step aged sample has more pronounced serrated stress-strain flow behavior that likely results from the presence of higher concentration of Ti and Al atoms in the γ-matrix solid solution (due to a high degree of under-aging) that enhances dislocation pinning.

3.4.1.1 Deformation and Fracture Behavior at Elevated Temperatures.
Crystal lattice expands at elevated temperatures, and the movement of dislocations becomes easier.
The degree of grain elongation is considerably lower and slip lines become more widely spaced after tensile testing at elevated temperatures.
Figure 29 presents the fracture surface morphologies of LP-DED F. The fracture surface displays predominantly ductile transgranular fracture mode.
However, small partial intergranular fracture zones are present near the gauge surface.
The presence of isolated partial intergranular fracture zones contributes to the reduction in ductility from 35 – 45% at room temperature to 25 – 30% at 1200 °F.
Grain boundaries provide additional strengthening effects to metallic materials at lower temperature but can become the weakest link when the temperature exceeds 0.5 Tm (melting temperature), which is approximately 1250 °F for LP-DED s by mixed dislocation slip and grain sliding when grain boundaries become weaker than grain interior at elevated temperatures.
The presence of intergranular fracture indicates grain boundary sliding became more prominent when tensile testing at 1200 °F, causing some cracks to develop along grain boundaries as shown in Figure 29.

The change from the standard single step aging cycle to a lower temperature two step aging cycle resulted in further improvement in ductility.

3.4.2 LCF Properties in Ambient Air.
Tension-compression type of low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were performed in air at room temperature at strain ratio (R) of –1 and total strain of 1% and 2%.
The LCF samples were heat treated with two different aging cycles.
Table 9 presents the LCF test results that include inelastic strain range at the mid-life cycle (N ), the cycle to crack initiation (N), and cycle to failure (N ).
h i f The change in the aging treatment from 1-step to 2-step has little effects on inelastic strain range.
At 1% total strain, the inelastic strain range varies from 0.34 – 0.35% in the 1-step aged condition )isk( htgnertS dleiY dna elisneT and from 0.32 – 0.36% in the 2-step aged condition.
When the total strain is increased to 2%, the inelastic strain varies from 1.17 – 1.21% in the 1-step aged condition and from 1.19 – 1.23% in the 2-step aged condition.
However, the change in aging treatment from 1-step to 2-step has significant effects on LCF life.
At 1% total strain, the LCF life is approximately 30 – 50% longer when the specimens were in 2-step aged condition.
The 2-step aged samples also exhibit longer fatigue crack initiation life than those heat treated with 1-step aging cycle.
This is consistent with the tensile test results that 2-step aging results in higher ductility and strain hardening exponent than 1-step aging, which is essential for LCF critical components such as LRE nozzles.
However, the effect of aging treatment on LCF life appears to be less significant when the total strain is increased to 2%.
At 2% total strain, the average LCF life increases moderately by 15 – 20% when the specimens were in 2-step aged condition.
The tendency to delay crack initiation also increases slightly by 10 – 15% for the 2-step aged material at 2% total strain.

To better understand the LCF behavior of LP-DED analyzed using hysteresis loops.
The specimens were heat treated to two different aging conditions.
The typical hysteresis loops of the first cycle, the peak stress cycle, and the cycle that is near half-life for total strain of 1.0% and 2.0% are illustrated in Figure 31 and 32.
The hysteresis loops of most materials typically vary more significantly in the initial cycles and stabilize around the half-life cycle.
The area within a hysteresis loop is energy dissipated during a cycle, which is usually in the form of heating from the plastic deformation.
Nearly symmetrical hysteresis loops can be observed under both aging conditions and strain amplitudes.
The shape of hysteresis loops varied slightly with the level of total strain.
Higher total strain resulted in larger plastic strain range and wider hysteresis loops.
For each aging condition, there is significant cyclic strain hardening in the first 10 – 30 cycles.
The peak tensile/compression stresses decreased slightly near the half cycle due to cyclic stabilization after the initial cyclic hardening.
One noticeable difference on the hysteresis loops is the degree of cyclic hardening between the samples processed with different aging cycles.
As shown in Figure 31, the samples that were heat treated with 2-step aging cycle show more pronounced cyclic hardening response than those heat treated with 1-step aging cycle.
At 1% total strain, the peak tensile stress increased slightly (by 2.6 ksi) from 90.5 ksi at the 1st cycle to 93.1 ksi at the half life cycle for the 1-step aged sample.
In comparison, the peak tensile stress increased (by 7.2 ksi) from 77.7 ksi at the 1st cycle to 84.9 ksi at the half life cycle for the 2-step aged sample.
At 2% total strain, the peak tensile stress increased modestly (by 9.7 ksi) from 100.3 ksi in the 1st cycle to 110.0 ksi at the half life cycle for the 1-step aged sample are shown in Figure 32.
In comparison, the peak tensile stress increased more sig- nificantly (by 16.6 ksi) from 84.9 ksi in the 1st cycle to 101.5ksi at the half life cycle for the 2-step aged sample.
The hysteresis loops clearly show that the 2-step aged sample has higher cyclic strain hardening capability than the 1-step aged sample.
This is consistent with the strain hardening behavior of tensile tested samples that strain hardening capability for LP-DED treatment.

3.4.2.2 Cyclic Stress Response.
The evolution of peak tensile stress (σ ) and compres- max sive stress (σ ) with respect to the number of cycles (N) at two different total strains is shown min in Figure 33.
The variation of tensile and compressive stress magnitude with number of cycle (N) is dependent on the applied total strain and the condition of aging.
Both 1-step and 2-step aged samples display significant cyclic strain hardening in the first 10 – 30 cycles.
The initial cyclic hard- ening was brief and the peak stress curve became noticeably flattened as cyclic hardening response leveled off.
The peak stresses of 1-step aged samples were always higher than that of 2-step aged samples before crack initiation.
However, the 2-step aged samples exhibit more pronounced cyclic hardening than 1-step aged samples.
Both crack initiation life and fatigue life can be determined from the peak tensile stress vs. cycle (N) plot.
The LCF specimens maintain a cyclically stable condition for approximately 70 – 80% of the fatigue life until the onset of crack initiation (Ni), after which accelerated cyclic softening occurred.
Onset of LCF crack initiation can be determined when a rapid drop in the peak tensile stress occurred.
It is evident that most of the LCF life is spent in crack initiation.
The regime of rapid cyclic softening occurs at final stage of LCF testing, approximately within the final 10 – 15% of the fatigue life.
The growth of fatigue crack accelerated at late stage of LCF testing and cyclic stress amplitude drops rapidly until final fracture.
Final fracture of the LCF samples was gradual as there is no sign of a sudden drop in the peak tensile stress amplitude after crack initiation.

)isk( ssertS noisserpmoC/noisneT kaeP )isk( ssertS noisserpmoC/noisneT kaeP The division of the total fatigue life into different stages (crack initiation, crack propagation, and final fracture) is an important consideration in regard to fatigue assessment.48 Many fatigue assessments focus on the stages when a fatigue crack grows to a detectable size.
The LCF data indi- cates that two-step aging seems to be able to delay fatigue crack initiation, which is significant as engineering materials often contain inherent defects and the use of total life approaches can lead to overestimation of useful fatigue life.
Some mechanical components are designed based on crack ini- tiation life as the problem in its initial stage (after the sign of initial crack initiation) can be efficiently controlled by NDE inspection to determine the extent of crack advance.48 In other words, it is safer to take preventive rather than corrective maintenance action to prevent unexpected catastrophic failure.
Overall, 2-step aging is better suited for LCF critical applications than one-step aging as it leads to longer LCF life by making the material more ductile, enhancing strain hardening capability and delaying crack initiation.
3.4.2.3 Cyclic Hardening Analysis.
In order to quantitatively compare the effects of strain amplitude and aging treatment on the cyclic stress response, the ratios of cyclic hardening and cyclic softening were calculated.
Cyclic hardening ratio (HR) and cyclic softening ratio (SR) can be expressed as follows: = (⊗σ max – ⊗σ first )/ ⊗σ first (5) = (⊗σ max – ⊗σ half )/ ⊗σ max (6) Where Δσ , Δσ , and Δσ represent the stress amplitudes at the maximum, first cycle and max first half half cycle, respectively.45,50 Table 10 shows the comparison of the stress amplitudes at the maximum (Δσ ), first cycle (Δσ ) and half-life (Δσ ) cycles for LP-DED 2-step aged conditions.
As can be seen in Table 10, the 2-step aged specimens exhibited higher HR and lower SR than the 1-step aged specimens at both 1% and 2% total strain.
The hardening ratio (HR) and softening ratio (SR) as a function of the total strain are shown in Figure 34.
Both HR and SR values increase with increasing strain amplitude.
The samples in 2-step aged condition exhibit higher HR but lower SR than those in 1-step aged condition.
As a result, the 2-step aged samples exhibit larger differences between the values of HR and SR than the 1-step aged samples at both total stain amplitudes.
HR and SR are two important parameters in characterizing cyclic deforma- tion behavior.
Higher HR and lower SR indicate enhanced cyclic hardening that enables the cyclic plastic deformation to become more homogeneous.
These observations further confirm that 2-step aging is better suited for LCF critical applications than 1-step aging.

Fatigue life of a component can be divided to five stages: dis- location movement, crack nucleation, micro-crack propagation, macro-crack propagation, and the final fracture.48 The first three stages are treated as the crack initiation phase followed by a macro-crack propagation phase and final fracture.
Figure 35 and 36 provides details regarding LCF fracture behavior of LP-DED k propagation, under 1% and 2% total strain amplitudes.
The LCF specimens were heat treated with two different aging cycles.
There are three distinct zones on the fracture surface consisting of fatigue crack ini- tiation, crack propagation, and final fast-fracture regions (as indicated by dashed white and yellow lines).
There are multiple crack initiation sites in each specimen.
It can be seen from Figure 35 that the fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface at 1% total strain in both 1-step and 2-step aged specimens.
As shown in Figure 35(c), the crack initiation site has distinct slip bands along certain crystallographic planes and directions.
Slip bands are a result of the systematic buildup of fine dislocation slip movements.
There are multiple crack initiation sites in the crack initiation region at 2% total strain and the small cracks grew along several different directions in the early stage of crack propaga- tion.
The cracks grew, coalesced, and propagated further until the final fracture.
Striation marks are very distinct in the fatigue propagation zone as shown in Figure 35(d).
The striation spacing during the early stage of crack propagation ranges from 0.5 – 1 µm at 1% total strain.
At 2% total strain (see Fig.
36), the fatigue crack also initiated along certain crystallographic planes near the specimen surface.
Some fatigue propagation striations can be clearly seen, although a significant portion of the fracture surface was smeared due to repeated tensile-compression loadings.
At 2% total strain, the striation spacing is approximately 2 – 10 µm during the early stage of crack propa- gation.
The width of a striation increases significantly when the total strain increases from 1% to 2% as the increase in stress intensity leads to higher fatigue crack growth rate.
Fatigue striation mark is the typical characteristic of crack propagation in a very ductile material.45 Striations on the fatigue fracture surface show the incremental growth of a fatigue crack.
Each striation represents fatigue crack growth per cycle and the width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate.
There is no sign that the fatigue cracks initiated from the near surface defects, such as internal pores.
The small fatigue cracks grew and coalesced and advanced further in a direction normal to the applied stress, forming a large propagation zone.
The final fracture area is significantly larger when the total strain was increased from 1% to 2%.
The most noticeable differences between the two aging cycles (1-step vs., 2-step aging) were in the crack propagation zone.
The crack propagation zone appears to be larger in 2-step aged specimen, which correlates well with its higher cyclic hardening capability and longer LCF life.

3.4.2.5 LP-DED and Wrought between LP-DED and wrought f the LP-DED process on LCF behavior.
The LP-DED LCF specimens were heat treated with two different aging cycles (1-step and 2-step aging), while the wrought specimens were heat treated with the standard 1-step aging at 1325 °F/16h.
As shown in Figure 37, the LCF strain-life curves look similar between wrought and LP-DED of 1-step and 2-step aged LP-DED samples varies from 5054 – 8318 cycles and 7581 – 11765 cycles, respectively.
LCF life of LP-DED ly shorter than that of wrought 2500 cycles at 1% total strain.
At 2% total strain, the LCF life of 1-step and 2-step aged LP-DED samples varies from 828 – 898 cycles and 880 – 1298 cycles, respectively.
LCF life of LP-DED rable to that of wrought % total strain.
With optimized chemi- cal composition and heat treatment, the LCF life of LP-DED omparable to the wrought alloy.

)%( niartS latoT 3.4.3 Tensile Properties in High Pressure Hydrogen Environment As the initial material screening to evaluate the susceptibility of hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) for LP-DED a 5 ksi high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment at ambient temperature.
HEE is commonly known as the degradation of certain mechanical properties that occur while the material is exposed to a high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment under the influence of an applied stress.26 HEE effects are a function of temperature and maximum HEE susceptibility usually occurs near room temperature.
The tensile ductility degradation of smooth tensile specimens, tested in hydrogen as compared to that in helium, is commonly used to gauge HEE susceptibility.26 Figure 38 shows the microstructure (in x-z plane) of the LP-DED esting in hydrogen.
A high degree of recrystallization had taken place after heat treatment and the average grain size is ~75 µm.
Grain boundary looks very clean as the undesirable grain-boundary η phase is reduced to a very low level with the new heat treatment.
Figure 38.
The typical microstructure (in x-z plane) of the LP-DED n 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen environment.
The average grain size is approx- imately 75 µm.
Tensile samples were heat treated using two different aging treatments, 1325 °F/16h (1-step aging) and 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h (2-step aging).
Initial tensile testing was performed in 5 ksi gaseous helium environment at a strain rate of 0.05 in/in/min to provide a baseline comparison to the 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen.
Strain rate was reduced to 0.0001 in/in/min when tensile testing in noitceriD dliuB DED-PL 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen environment to maximize the effects of HEE.
Table 11 presents the ten- sile properties for LP-DED i gaseous helium and hydrogen environments.
The average tensile properties for wrought hydrogen environments are also given in Table 11.
As expected, the 2-step aged material exhibits lower strength but higher tensile ductility than the 1-step aged material in both helium and hydrogen environments.
Hydrogen does not seem to affect the strain hardening behavior for LP-DED n hydrogen is comparable to that in helium.
Ductility, as represented by total fracture elongation, was reduced from 34.50% to 28.75% in 1-step aged condition, and from 41.73% – 33.1% in 2-step aged condition.
Although there are some ductility reductions in hydrogen, it is significant to note that the tensile ductility of LP- DED high pressure gaseous hydrogen environ- ment for 7 – 10 hours under an extremely slow strain rate of 0.0001 in/in/min.

The YS ratios (GH /GHe) for LP-DED onditions were above 97%, indicating that hydrogen had little effect on the stress required to initiate plastic deformation.
Tensile elongation ratio in hydrogen vs. in helium (GH /GHe) was used to assess HEE susceptibility.
The samples in 2-step aged condition exhibited a lower ductility ratio than that in 1-step aged condition, but the fracture elongation of the 2-step aged material is higher than the 1-step material by ~ 4.35% in hydrogen.
Although LP-DED atios than the wrought alloy, the tensile ductility of LP-DED ent is significantly higher than that of the conventional wrought alloy by 5 – 10%.
The variation in the GH /GHe ductility ratio between LP-DED ributed to the discrepancy in the tensile testing strain rate.
The tensile testing strain rate for LP-DED oximately 20 – 30 times times slower than that for the wrought alloy (0.005 in/in/min).
The reduction in strain rate increases the exposure time in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment from approximately 20 – 25 minutes (0.005 in/in/min) for the wrought alloy to roughly 450 – 650 minutes (0.0001 in/in/ min) for the LP-DED alloy.
Since dislocation motion and its interaction with hydrogen is highly strain rate sensitive, the HEE effects are expected to become more pronounced when tensile test- ing at a slower strain rate.51 The use of tensile ductility ratio (as shown in Table 12) is intended for initial screening to gauge the effects of HEE and should not be used for component design.
Addi- tional mechanical testing in high pressure hydrogen environment is needed to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on other critical mechanical properties such as low cycle fatigue, high cycle fatigue, and fatigue crack growth, etc.

All specimens display con- tinuous strain hardening before reaching the UTS.
Distinct necking can be observed from the stress-strain curves and the development of tensile fracture was gradual as there is still 4 – 5 % duc- tility (fracture elongation) between the onset of necking and final fracture.
Serrated stress-strain behavior was found for both 1-step and 2-step aged samples in hydrogen, indicative of Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect.52 The PLC effect manifests itself as an unstable plastic flow during tensile testing under certain conditions of strain rate and temperature.
It has been reported that hydro- gen can trigger PLC effect in traditional wrought and AM 718 alloy at room temperature.52 The serrated stress-strain flow behavior is caused by the dragging effect of hydrogen atoms on disloca- tions.
Occurrence of a drag force requires two conditions: (1) formation of hydrogen atmospheres at the dislocations and (2) the hydrogen atmospheres move with but lag behind the dislocations.
The drag force of hydrogen atoms is strain rate dependent.
Lower strain rate increases the drag force because reduced strain rate permits more competitive motion between hydrogen atoms and dislocations to form hydrogen atmospheres around the dislocations.
As a result, repeated locking and unlocking of dislocations by hydrogen creates serrations in the stress-strain curves.

Engineering stress-strain curves of LP-DED lium and hydrogen environment in (a) 1-step aged and (b) 2-step aged conditions.
Serrated stress-strain flow behavior is observed for samples tested in high pressure hydrogen environment.
Plastic deformation occurs more uniformly in the initial stages of a tensile test as the dif- fusion distance of hydrogen is still very short.
As tensile testing continues, the dislocation density continues to increase and more hydrogen atoms can be transported and accumulate in the regions with high plastic deformation.
For LP-DED effects become more pronounced when the plastic strain exceeds 12% as hydrogen is increasingly accu- mulated in the regions that have high dislocation density.
The effects of HEE became more pro- nounced when the plastic instability occurs after the onset of necking.
PLC results in localization of plastic deformation and the serrations become more intense in the post-necking region when local damage occurred.53 The serrations on the stress-strain curves are more pronounced in the 1- step aged specimen than in the 2-step aged specimen, which may be caused by the difference in their strain hardening behavior.
Compared with the 2-step aged samples, the samples in 1-step aged condition exhibit lower strain-hardening capability.
As a result, deformation takes place by more heterogeneous dislocation slip that results in deformation localization and more pronounced PLC effects.54 3.4.3.1 Hydrogen-induced surface cracking.
Surface characteristics of tensile tested specimens were analyzed using optical microscopy.
As shown in Figure 40, the specimen surface exhibited unusual “orange peel” appearance after prolonged tensile testing in high pressure hydrogen environment.
Many surface cracks are present and distributed along the machining marks.
Per the ASTM G-142 standard, tensile specimen for evaluation of hydrogen effect should be machined to have a surface finish of 32 µin or better to minimize the amount of cold work on the gauge surface.
However, examination of specimen surface finish found the gage surface finish is approximately 75 µin, which is significantly coarser than the 32 µin specified by ASTM G-142.
)isk( ssertS gnireenignE )isk( ssertS gnireenignE Machining marks are stress concentration sites that are known to promote crack initiation and affect tensile ductility.55 The gage section having a rougher surface finish could be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the reduced tensile fracture elongation in 5 ksi GH environment for LP-DED essure gaseous hydrogen environment will use specimens that have surface roughness conforming to the ASTM G-142 standard to avoid localized grooves (such as machining marks) that promote surface cracking.

This specimen was in 2-step aged condition.
An in-depth analysis of the deformed microstructure was performed to see the effects of hydrogen.
Cross-sectional views of a fractured tensile specimen, which is heat treated with 2-step aging cycle, are shown in Figure 41.
The fracture surface is oriented at approximately 45° with respect to the tensile loading direction, which corresponds to the plane of near maximum shear stress.
Figure 41(b) reveals signs of plastic deformation in the specimen shoulder region, which indicates the material is very ductile in hydrogen and plastic deformation extends outside the specimen gauge section.
The depth of surface cracks and the surrounding microstructure is shown in Figure 41(b) and (c).
Most surface cracks are 20 – 60 µm deep along the machining marks and oriented at approximately 30 – 45° with respect to the loading direction.
This further demonstrates that LP-DED ous hydrogen environment as the sur- face cracks initiated by ductile shear mode.
Grain structure becomes more heavily deformed near the fracture surface.
As shown in Figure 41(d) and (e), the fracture surface exhibits typical ductile transgranular type of fracture mode and there is no sign of brittle intergranular fracture.

Cross-sectional views of a fractured tensile specimen, which is heat treated with 1-step aging cycle, are shown in Figure 42.
As is the case with the 2-step aged specimen, the 1-step aged specimen also displays similar deformation and fracture characteristics after tensile testing in hydrogen.
Many surface cracks, 30–100 µm deep, initiated from the machining marks and grew along the plane of maximum shear stress.
Many fine slip lines can be clearly seen that indicates the material remained very ductile under the influence of high-pressure gaseous hydrogen.
As shown in Figure 42 (b) and (c), the final fracture surface exhibits the typical characteristics of shear-dominated ductile transgranular mode, and there is no sign of a brittle intergranular type of fracture.

3.4.3.2 Hydrogen Diffusion Analysis and Strain Rate Effects.
For metals stressed in a gas- eous hydrogen environment, hydrogen-induced crack initiation typically starts at the gas-metal surface.56 Hydrogen can dissociate on metal surfaces into H-atom and be physically absorbed and transported by diffusion through metal lattice.
Upon further loading, the absorbed H-atom can be transported by dislocations to the regions of high stress and interacts with the material at the crack tip.
In alloy 718 (Inconel 718), the resistance to HEE is related to hydrogen diffusion behavior and hydrogen transport by diffusion is an important consideration for interpreting susceptibil- ity to HEE.57 Diffusivity of hydrogen in superalloys varies slightly with composition of alloys.
The diffusivity of lattice hydrogen at room temperature is on the order of 10–16 m2/s in Fe-Cr-Ni austenitic steels and 2× 10–15 m2/s in alloy 718.58,59 The depth of hydrogen diffusion in LP-DED sivity of alloy 718 in hydrogen at room temperature (2 × 10–15 m2/s).
The diffusion distance of hydrogen has a square root dependence on diffusivity and can be determined from the Equation below: ∼ (7) where x is the diffusion distance traveled by the diffusing hydrogen atoms in one direction along one axis, D is diffusivity, and t is the elapsed time since diffusion began.58 The diffusivity determines the time it takes for a hydrogen atom to diffuse a given distance in an alloy.
Diffusion time increases with the square of diffusion distance and is inversely proportional to the diffusivity (D).
The tensile testing strain rate for LP-DED hich is more than an order of magnitude slower than that for the wrought alloy (0.005 in/in/min).
The reduction in strain rate increases the testing time in a high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment from 20 – 25 minutes (at 0.005 in/in/min) for the wrought alloy to 450 – 650 minutes (at 0.0001 in/in/ min strain rate) for the LP-DED alloy.
When a tensile test is performed at a strain rate of 0.005 in/in/ min strain rate) for 20 – 25 minutes, hydrogen atoms were able to diffuse over a distance of approxi- mately 1.55 – 1.73 µm.
In comparison, when the strain rate is decresased to 0.0001 in/in/min, the exposure time in the hydrogen environment increases to 450 – 650 minutes, and the estimated depth of hydrogen diffusion at failure would increase from 2.19 to approximately 7.35 – 8.83 µm.
Therefore, the fraction of deforming material that is affected by hydrogen is considerably larger at 0.0001 in/ in/min than at 0.005 in/in/min strain rate as the exposure time to high pressure hydrogen increased from 20 – 25 minutes to more than 450 minutes.
This explains why HEE is more pronounced when tensile testing is performed at a lower strain rate.
The calculated hydrogen diffusion distance of 7.35 – 8.83 µm (at 0.0001 in/in/min strain rate) is shorter than the observed depth of surface cracks, which is 20 – 100 µm in most cases.
The discre- pencies could be caused by enhanded lattice diffusivity of hydrogen due to expanded crystal lattice (by elastic strain) or by dislocation asssisted transporation.
HEE is more pronounced at a lower strain rate because slow strain rate increases testing duration and promotes interaction of hydrogen and the moving dislocations.59,60 At a higher strain rate, the diffusion of hydrogen may not be able to follow the dislocation motion.
In contrast, hydrogen can diffuse deeper and follow the disloca- tion motion when strain rate is decreased to a certain level.
Therefore, the interaction of hydrogen with dislocation is enhanced and higher amount of hydrogen can be effectively transported by dislocations to the high stress regions when the strain rate is very slow.
It is significant to note that LP-DED n than the wrought alloy in high pressure hydrogen environment, despite tensile testing was conducted at a strain rate that is slower by one order of magnitude.
The exceptional ductility of LP-DED (1) clean grain boundary that has very low density of detrimental η phase and (2) excep- tional high ductility and strain hardening exponent that increase its ability to homogenize plastic deformation and retard stress concentration.
3.4.3.3 Effects of Hydrogen on Fracture Features.
Fracture surfaces were analyzed using SEM to explore the effects of hydrogen on tensile fracture behavior.
Figure 43 shows the SEM images of a 1-step aged sample after tensile testing in hydrogen.
As shown, the fracture surface exhibits hydrogen-induced quasi-cleavage fracture near the specimen surface, a transition region with a mixed mode of quasi-cleavage and dimpled fracture, and ductile dimple fracture toward the central region.
The quasi-cleavage fracture surface is typically flat but some traces of shallow dimples can be clearly seen in the high resolution images (Fig.
43(c), (d)).
Transport of hydrogen by dislocations is enhanced when the strain rate is low as a higher amount of hydrogen can be trans- ported to the stress concentration sites.59,60 The interaction of gaseous hydrogen with the tensile sample is initially confined within its outer region.
Surface cracks initiated and continued to grow.
Hydrogen was transported deep into the material towards the end of the tensile test, leading to reduced fracture elongation.
Outside of the transition region, the fracture surface exhibits pre- dominant ductile failure toward the central region of the fracture surface.
Intergranular fracture, which is the most severe form of HEE, is not present on the fracture surface.

Mixed quasi-cleavage fracture and ductile dimpled surface are the main characteristics near the specimen surface, indicative of hydrogen effects.
As shown in Figure 44, the fracture surface exhibits hydrogen-induced quasi-cleavage fracture near the specimen sur- face, a transition region with a mixed mode of quasi-cleavage and dimpled fracture, and ductile dimple fracture toward the central region.
The quasi-cleavage fracture surface is flat and mixed with secondary cracking but some traces of shallow dimples can be clearly seen in the high resolution image (Fig.
44(c), (d)).
The fracture surface exhibits predominant ductile failure out- side the transition region.
Although there are a few hydrogen affected quasi-cleavage regions on the fracture surface, the 2-step aged samples remains very ductile and have more than 33% frac- ture elongation after tensile testing in high pressure hydrogen environment for 8 – 10 hours.
Overall, LP-DED ure hydrogen and the fracture surface exhibits no signs of hydrogen-induced brittle intergranular facture.
Additional tensile testing is being completed for LP-DED vironment using three different strain rates, 0.005, 0.0005, and 0.0001 in/in/min, so that the resistance to HEE for LP-DED red under the same testing conditions.

3.4.4 LCF Properties in High Pressure Gaseous Hydrogen Environment LCF is the primary service life limit factor for LRE nozzles.
High pressure gaseous hydro- gen environment is known to have a considerable effect on LCF properties for HEE susceptible materials.
In general, the strain-controlled LCF test is more sensitive to HEE than the load-con- trolled high cycle fatigue (HCF) test.26 The greatest reduction in LCF life in high pressure hydro- gen environment is found at near room temperature for most superalloys.
Therefore, LCF testing was performed in 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen environment at room temperature at a strain ratio of –1 (R = –1) and a total strain of 2% to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on fatigue crack initiation and cycles to failure.
The selection of 2% total strain range for LCF test in hydrogen is based on the projection that the maximum total strain the channel wall nozzle experiences during hot firing is around 2% in most cases.61 Table 13 shows the LCF test results that include inelastic strain range, cycles to crack initiation, and cycles to failure.
The LCF samples were heat treated with two differ- ent aging cycles.
The inelastic strain increased slightly when the aging treatment is switched from 1-step to 2-step.
The samples heat treated with 2-step aging cycle exhibit longer crack initiation life (Ni = 860 – 865 cycles) than those heat treated with 1-step aging (Ni = 660 –760 cycles).
Samples in 2-step aged condition also exhibit slightly longer LCF life than that in 1-step aged condition.

half Strain-controlled LCF life generally depends not only on the strength-ductility properties but also on the cyclic hardening behavior.
To quantitively study the effect of hydrogen on cyclic hardening behavior, the ratios of cyclic hardening ratio (HR) and cyclic softening ratio (SR) were calculated using Equation (5) and (6).
HR and SR are two important parameters in characterizing cyclic deformation behavior and the results are shown in Table 14.
As shown in Table 14, the 2- step aged specimen exhibited a high HR and a lower HR at 2% total strain in hydrogen.
This is consistent with the LCF test results in ambient air that samples in 2-step aged condition have more pronounced cyclic hardening response than that in 1-step aged condition.
The material with a higher HR and a lower SR tends to possess enhanced cyclic hardening capability that can homogenize plastic deformation and prolong LCF life.
The 2-step aged specimens having longer crack initiation life can be attributed to the enhanced cyclic hardening ability, which leads to more homogeneous plastic deformation and delayed crack initiation.

Cyclic hardening behavior was analyzed using hysteresis loops to understand the LCF behavior of LP-DED ent.
The hysteresis loops of the first cycle, cycle 15, and the half-life cycle for both 1-step and 2-step aged samples are illustrated in Figure 45.
The hysteresis loops are nearly symmetrical under both aging conditions.
There is significant cyclic hardening in the early cycles and the strain hardening response stabilizes and reaches a steady state near the half-life cycle.
One noticeable difference is the level of cyclic hardening varies with aging treatment.
As shown in Figure 45, the peak cyclic tensile stress increased by 12.9 ksi from 97.1 ksi in the 1st cycle to 110.0 ksi at the half life cycle in 1-step aged condition.
In comparison, the peak tensile stress increased by 19.3 ksi from 80.2 in the 1st cycle to 99.5 ksi at the half life cycle in 2-step aged condition.
It is evident that 2-step aging enhances cyclic hardening response.
This is consistent with the LCF test results in ambient air that samples in 2-step aged condition display more pronounced cyclic hardening response than that in 1- step aged condition.

3.4.4.2 Cyclic Stress Response.
The variations in the magnitudes of the peak tensile (σ ) max and compressive stresses (σ ) with number of cycles (N) at two different aged conditions are shown min in Figure 46.
Strain amplitude is held constant throughout the test and peak tensile and compres- sive stresses are plotted for each aging cycle.
Both 1-step and 2-step aged samples display significant cyclic strain hardening in the first 10 – 15 cycles.
The initial cyclic hardening was very brief, and the cyclic hardening response decreased progressively and reached a stable state after approximately 200 cycles.
Both crack initiation life and fatigue life can be determined from the stress vs. cycle (N) plot.
The material maintains a cyclically stable condition for 70% – 80% of the fatigue life until the onset of crack initiation (Ni), after which accelerated cyclic softening occurred at final LCF stage, approximately within the final 10% – 20% of the fatigue life.
The growth of fatigue crack accelerated at late stage of LCF testing and cyclic stress amplitude falls rapidly until the final fracture.
Failure of the LCF samples was gradual as there is no sign of an abrupt drop in stress amplitude after crack initiation.

Variations of peak tensile stress (σ ) and compressive stress (σ ) with number of max min cycles (N) at 2% total strain (1% strain amplitude) in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment.
The LCF specimens were heat treated with two different aging cycles.
The total LCF life can be divided into two parts: crack initiation life and crack propagation life.
It is often considered that the fatigue life is determined by crack initiation cycle, Ni.
After the Ni cycle, crack propagation accelerates and the load carrying capability of the component drops quickly.
Due to the presence of a sizable crack, the component becomes fracture critical, and its safety and reliability depend on damage tolerance assessment and control.
2-step aging appears to provide a higher resistance to crack initiation that can be attributed to the enhanced cyclic hard- ening capability (higher HR and lower SR) as shown in Table 14.
Therefore, 2-step aging treatment is better suited for components that are to be used for LCF critical applications in high pressure hydrogen environments, such as some HEE sensitive components for LRE applications.
3.4.4.3 LCF Induced Fracture Features in Hydrogen.
SEM was used to examine the frac- ture surfaces to observe the effects of hydrogen on LCF fracture behavior.
Figure 47 shows the fracture surfaces of LP-DED ditions.
There are three distinct regions on the fracture surface that consist of fatigue-crack initiation, crack propa- gation, and final fast-fracture zones (as indicated by dashed white and yellow lines).
It can be seen from Figure 48(a) that the fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface, caused by localized dislocation slip bands on certain crystallographic planes.
Slip bands are a result of the system- atic buildup of fine dislocation slip movements.
There is no sign that the fatigue cracks initiated from the near surface defects, such as internal pores.
Both 1-step and 2-step aged specimens have )isk( sessertS noisserpmoC/noisneT multiple crack initiation sites.
The small fatigue cracks grew, coalesced, and advanced further in a direction normal to the applied stress, forming a large propagation zone as shown in Figure 47.
Both 1-step and 2-step aged specimens exhibit similar fracture surface characteristics.
The most noticeable difference between the samples tested in ambient air (see Fig.
36) and in 5 ksi hydro- gen environment (see Fig.
47) is in the crack initiation stage.
The LCF samples tested in hydro- gen exhibit an increase in the crack initiation density (more fatigue crack initiation sites in the initiation zone) than that tested in ambient air.
This is consistent with the findings that hydrogen increases the density of fatigue induced surface cracks due to enhanced interaction of dislocation slip bands with hydrogen.62 1-step, LCF, GH 2-step, LCF, GH (a) (b) Figure 47.
LCF fracture surfaces of LP-DED si high pressure hydrogen environment in (a) 1-step and (b) 2-step aged condition.
Overall, the fracture surfaces of the LCF specimens tested in hydrogen displays no signs of brittle intergranular facture.
There are distinct striation marks in the fatigue propagation zone as shown in Figure 48.
Striations are fatigue propagation marks produced on the fracture surface that show the incremental growth of a fatigue crack.
Striations are generally not seen when a crack is small, but begin to appear as the crack becomes larger.
Each striation represents fatigue crack growth per cycle and the width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate.
The striation spacing during the early stage of crack propagation ranges from 10 – 20 µm.
Fatigue stria- tion mark is the typical characteristic of crack propagation in a very ductile material.44 Therefore, the presence of distinct fatigue striations indicates LP-DED sting in high pressure hydrogen environment.

3.4.4.4 Comparison of LCF Behavior in Air and Hydrogen.
LCF testing in a high pressure hydrogen environment has little effect on the fatigue life of LP-DED ent air.
As shown in Figure 49, LCF life of LP-DED in air at 2% total strain.
In 1-step aged condition, the average LCF life is 870 cycles in ambient air and 876 cycles in hydrogen at 2% total strain amplitude.
In 2-step aged condition, the average LCF life is 1053 cycles in air and 918 cycles in hydrogen at 2% total strain.
Overall, the 2-step aged material exhibit longer LCF life than the 1-step aged material in both ambient air and hydrogen environments.
For LCF testing at 2% total strain, plastic strain component predominates and ductility is more important than strength.
Therefore, it is not surprising to see LP-DED total strain amplitude in both ambient air and hydrogen as it is very ductile and has high strain hardening capability that prolongs fatigue life.
The excellent LCF performance in hydrogen makes LP-DED es that are subjected to repeated thermal and mechanical loads in the challenging high pressure hydrogen environment.

Although wrought ile fracture elongation in 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen environment, the presence of hydrogen significantly degrades its LCF life.5 In comparison, high pressure hydrogen environment has little effect on the LCF life of LP-DED onducted by the standard 1-step cycle at 1325 °F/16h.

In 1-step aged condition, the average LCF life in hydrogen is 876 cycle for LP-DED oy at 2% total strain.
The average LCF life in hydrogen increased to 918 cycles for the 2-step aged material.
It is obvious that the LCF resistance of LP-DED environment is superior to that of the wrought alloy.

)%( niartS latoT Low cycle fatigue (strain life fatigue) depends on the strength-ductility properties and the cyclic hardening or softening behaviors of the material.
The cyclic hardening behavior of wrought loop data is unavailable.
However, cyclic hard- ening behavior can be estimated using the tensile UTS/YS ratio.63 Table 15 compares the tensile properties and UTS/YS ratio for LP-DED and wrought en environments.64 As shown, wrought 6) than the LP-DED alloy (1.64 – 1.87) in high pressure hydrogen environment.
Having a lower UTS/ YS ratio suggests the wrought alloy would have lower cyclic hardening capability than the LP- DED alloy.
Dislocation slip character can play an important role in the HEE susceptibility.60 Microstructure that can homogenization plastic strain and avoid strain concentration gener- ally contributes to higher resistance to fatigue crack initiation.
Therefore, LP-DED than its wrought counterpart in hydrogen can be attributed to cumulative effects of higher ductility and improved cyclic hardening capability.

The alternating tensile and compressive strains lead to surface intrusions that initiate fatigue cracks.
High pressure hydrogen environments can reduce LCF life by promoting planar dislocation slips and forming localized slip bands, which intensify metal/hydrogen interactions and accelerate fatigue crack initiation.60,62 Higher strength materials are not desirable for LCF critical applications as they generally increase plastic strain localization during LCF testing.
The ideal LCF resistant material for structural applications in high pressure hydrogen environment should have the following characteristics: (1) higher ductility and lower strength to accommodate plastic strains at critical locations (notches, inclusions, voids, etc.
); (2) a high strain hardening exponent to enhance cyclic hardening and maintain cyclic stability; (3) clean grain boundaries that are free of deleterious η phase to minimize HEE susceptibility.
Therefore, it is postulated that wrought hydro- gen can be attributed to its higher strength, lower ductility, and lower cyclic hardening capability.
For LP-DED ability minimizes strain localization under the influence of hydrogen, leading to delayed crack initiation and improved LCF perfor- mance in high pressure hydrogen environment.

In metals, heat transfer is primarily carried by electrons and impurities will distort crystal lattice, impede electron movement, and reduce conductivity.71 Comparing to the wrought alloy (having the highest alloying element content), the reduced alloying element content and lower impurity level maybe the reasons that contribute to increased thermal conductivity for LP-DED s in the measured thermophysical properties across different testing labs, it can be concluded that LP- DED rmal conductivity than the wrought alloy.
The increase in thermal conductivity can be attributed to the optimization of chemical composition and heat treatment LP-DED y material properties.
3.5 Hardware manufacturing factured various components using the fabricated as manufacturing technology dem- onstrators (MTD’s) and completed various hot-fire testing campaigns to demonstrate in the actual hydrogen environment (Fig.

Several components were deposited using 350W, 1070W, and 2620W power parameters using LP-DED.
The lower power allows for thin walls deposited at approximately 1 mm generally used for channel wall nozzles.
The higher power increases the deposition rates for thicker wall components that are often final machined and have limited inter- nal features.
The components demonstrated include powerhead half shells used for the RS-25 powerhead, manifolds for nozzles and chambers, transfer tubes, domes, and other pressure loaded components that are used in hydrogen environments.

CONCLUSIONS (1) The Fe-Ni-Cr hydrogen-resistant (AM) laser powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) has matured through process development, material characterization, and optimization of chemical composition and heat treatment.
iquid rocket engine components and bscale and full-scale channel wall nozzles in LP-DED ) The chemical composition of wrought OMP method.
An optimal composition (final formulation) has been determined by decreasing the overall Md value to retard precipitation of undesirable η phase and obtain an optimal balance of key materials properties.
The optimized final formulation is shown below: Alloy Fe Ni Cr Mo V W Co Ti Al LP-DED .80 2.40 0.25 (Final Formulation) (3) A new post-processing heat treatment has been successfully developed for LP-DED omogenization treatments can effectively mitigate elemental segregation and produce highly recrystallized microstructure.
The subsequent solution anneal and aging treatment help control precipitation kinetics of γ′ and mitigate precipiation of undersirable grain boundary η phase.
The optimized heat treatment process consists of the fol- lowing steps: – Stress relief at 1950 °F/1.5 hours with slow furnace cool, – Homogenization at 2125 °F/6 hours with argon quench, – Solution annealing at 1950 °F/1 hour with argon quench or faster, – 2-step Aging at 1275 °F/16 hours + 1150 °F/16 hours (total time is 32 hours).
(4) Comparing with the wrought alloy, LP-DED ficantly higher ductility and strain hardening capability.
Strength reduction is part of the trade to obtain an optimal balance of key material properties when using AM.
Ductility of LP- DED tested at a very slow strain rate of 0.0001 in/in/ min in hydrogen.
However, the 2-step aged material remains very ductile and has more than 33% fracture elongation after tensile testing in hydrogen for 8–10 hours.
(5) The combined effects of chemical composition and heat treatment optimization enable high quality e LP-DED method.
Changes from the standard single step aging cycle to a lower temperature two step aging cycle alter the characteristics of LP-DED fraction of γ ′ precipitate and retarding precipitation of the detrimental η phase.
As a result, LP-DED tant, which is important for low cycle fatigue critical components such as the LRE nozzles.
(6) The LCF performance of LP-DED rable to that of the wrought alloy in ambient air.
However, LP-DED ght alloy when LCF testing is conducted in a high-pressure gaseous hydrogen environment.
Due to its exceptional ductility and enhanced strain hardening capability, the LCF life of LP-DED rogen, which is vital for the success and safety of LRE nozzles.
