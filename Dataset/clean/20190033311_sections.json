AM offers a considerable departure from traditional manufacturing to rapidly fabricate components with complex internal features. High performance liquid rocket engine combustion chambers that operate in a high heat flux environment are fabricated using a copper-alloy liner with a series of integral coolant channels. Copper-alloys provide the necessary conductivity and material strength for adequate design margins offering high performance without the need for film coolant. Copper-alloys present unique challenges to properly melt the powder in laser-based AM processes due to their high reflectivity and conductivity. Starting in 2014, nd Glenn Research Center (GRC) have developed a process for AM of GRCop (Copper- Chrome-Niobium) alloys using Selective Laser Melting (SLM). GRCop, originally developed at GRC, is a high conductivity, high-strength, dispersion strengthened copper-alloy for use in high-temperature, high heat flux applications. acterization and testing, along with hot-fire testing, to demonstrate that GRCop-42 and GRCop-84 alloys are suitable for use in combustion chambers.

AM processes have been shown to significantly reduce the lead time for thrust chamber fabrication and reduce production costs, making use of alloys that optimize the performance of combustion chambers. Several AM processes, specifically laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) or selective laser melting (SLM), have matured over the last decade for a variety of materials, yet a limited number of metals are available using this process. While the availability of SLM materials for aerospace components is continuing to expand, a majority of the market is primarily focused on superalloys. specifically copper-alloys to make use of the AM process for combustion chambers.

GRCop-42 materials are compared in Fig. 2.

This comparison, pure copper is limited to approximately made GRCop-84 preferable for reusable launch vehicles 200\u00b0C, and most copper alloys cannot exceed 500\u00b0C [7]. requiring lives of hundreds of missions. Substitution of GRCop-42 or GRCop-84 for NARloy-Z, C-18150, or another precipitation strengthened copper- alloy, could result in a 200\u00b0C or more increase in temperature capability, providing higher performance trades or increased margin. These attributes, in addition to the rapid development of the GRCop alloys using the SLM process, make them an attractive option for use in high performance combustion chambers. The strengths of GRCop-42 and GRCop-84 exceed almost all other copper-based alloys in the 500-700\u00b0C range. They also exceed all other precipitation strengthened copper-based alloys at all temperatures if the part must be given a high temperature heat treatment IAC-19-C4.3.5x52514 Page 3 of 14 70th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), Washington D.C., United States, 21-25 October 2019.

The Cr Nb present in the powder particles is actually an agglomeration of finer Cr Nb particles formed in liquid copper during the gas atomization process. It appeared that thermal, and perhaps mechanical forces, acting upon the agglomerations broke them up and formed the finer particles seen in the SLM sample. This is important because basic strengthening mechanisms such as Ashby- Orowan strengthening predict that the strength of a material will be increased as the average diameter of the particles is decreased [14]. The AM process parameters for GRCop-42 were developed on the same MSFC Concept Laser M2 used for the LCUSP program for GRCop-84, and the parallel, Fig. 5.

At MSFC, development has been focused on the blown powder DED and electron beam DED. The blown powder DED fabrication technique uses a coaxial nozzle with a central laser source and powder injected (or blown) into the laser focus creating a melt pool and material deposition. The powder is accelerated, or blown, into the melt pool using an inert carrier gas to allow for minimal or reduced oxidation in the high temperature deposition/weld. This DED head system, with integrated focus optics and blown powder nozzle(s), is attached to a robot or gantry system that controls a toolpath defined by the CAD model. echnology using Inconel 625 on both Fig. 14.

MSFC has accumulated over 385 starts and 20,000 seconds on various AM GRCop-alloy and AM bimetallic chambers. The design of AM GRCop- alloy chambers has been discussed in prior literature [10,11,23]. From experience, the two main adjustments to the design process for AM SLM regenerative cooling chambers reside in accounting for the minimum feature size that can be reliably built using SLM and the resultant surface finish [23]. There are also complex geometric features, such as channel geometry and flowpaths that could not be manufactured with traditional techniques. The initial SLM GRCop-84 chambers that completed hot-fire tested used LOX/LCH4 at 4000 lb thrust-class. f A B A throat section was successfully regen-cooled with liquid methane during its testing in 2016 and further allowed thermal models to be developed to characterize two-phase flow, which occurred during the subcritical coolant\u2019s phase change. This chamber design went through a few design iterations to further optimize performance and weight. A series of modified methane cooled chambers later demonstrated active throttling, as C shown in Fig. 16, with full regen-cooling with an as-built D surface of the coolant channels. Smaller methane cooled chambers for 1,000 lb thrust were also developed and Fig. 15. Bimetallic LCUSP Chamber Development f successfully tested with active throttling capabilities.

In some development chambers, nearly 10% shrinkage was observed. The EBF3 used the highest heat input with the electron energy source, but required high heat to achieve good penetration of the Inconel 625 into the copper [22]. The blown powder did provide some reduction in heat with less distortion, but chambers still experienced 3-9% shrinkage. 4.

Several of the 1,200-2,400 lb thrust chambers units f served as workhorse hardware to hot-fire test a variety of new SLM injectors, along with channel-cooled nozzle designs and carbon-composite nozzle extensions [24]. These chambers included SLM GRCop-84 and later GRCop-42 liners. Test conditions, including Pc\u2019s, MR\u2019s, and coolant flow rates, were varied to challenge the SLM-fabricated chambers. Fig. 17 shows one of the tests with a Carbon-Carbon (C-C) nozzle. As part of this testing, chambers fabricated on different machines and with slightly different build parameters were evaluated. Some liners from industry partners were fabricated with 50% reduction in surface roughness (indicated by profilometer and optical measurements) that resulted in a Fig. 18. High Duty Cycle Testing on AM GRCop-42 more than 20% reduction in coolant pressure drop. Sustained peak wall temperatures were demonstrated up to 727\u00b0C (1,340 \u00b0F) on the SLM GRCop-42 liners. Results showed the resilience of the material at these elevated wall temperatures with consistent performance throughout the test series. The hot-fire testing demonstrated aggressive conditions with high Pc/MR and subsequent heat loads. The chambers were run aggressively to promote the environment for potential blanching, but none was observed in the liners.
