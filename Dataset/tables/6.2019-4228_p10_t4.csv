,"After a layer is completed, the build plate is lowered slightly, a new layer of powder is spread, and the laser sinters"
"the new build layer. Sufficient power is used to penetrate into a couple of the previous build layers, allowing proper",
bonding between layers. The process is repeated thousands of times until the part is fully fabricated or printed. This,
"allows for complex internal features to be fabricated, such as coolant channels. The entire build is completed in an",
inert environment that limits oxidation of the parts during fabrication. The SLM process and an example of a SLM,
"copper-alloy liner fabrication are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, respectively.",
