"Perceived operating 
temperature 1100°C +","RT Tensile properties less 
than matrix alone. 
W ductile-to-brittle 
transition temperature 150 
to 370°C; flaw sensitivity 
in brittle state.",-
"At elevated 
temperatures TFRS 
have superior 
properties: 
1.7x at 1090°C 
WTh02/Ni 
3.2x at 980°C 
WTh02/Co","Development centred on 
air-breathing aero engine 
requirements.","Effect of rocket 
engine environment 
with H-based fuels 
required."
"Improved stress 
rupture characteristics.","Some systems susceptible 
to thermal fatigue. 
FeCrAlY superior to other 
systems.","Full evaluation 
programme for most 
appropriate 
combination."
"FeCrAlY good 
corrosion/oxidation 
resistance.",High density.,"Need to establish 
long-term 
environmental 
stability."
"Considerable 
experience in applying 
conventional 
superalloys to high 
temperature 
environments.","Offer ~100°C improvement 
over the conventional and 
new superalloys.",-
