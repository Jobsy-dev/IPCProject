"Key Suppliers’ data.
(1) Values with grey background are actual data;
(2) Strength data estimated from data in literature for MMCs containing SiC. Due to the similarity
of Hexon SiB6 and SiC, similar reinforcement effects are expected;
(3) Estimated from rule of mixtures or a fit to actual data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
