Ref. 52 [1 to 10]","C-SiC & SiC-SiC traded as SEPCARBINOX & CERASEP. Produced by CVI 
techniques. SEP has the most advanced production capability in the world. 
Their ceramic matrix composites are applied to a wide range of propulsion 
units & thermal protection systems for space vehicles. Reasonable property 
data available. Technology licensed to DuPont."
SiC (Nicalon yarns),SiC,"ORNL, USA. 
Ref. 52 [11 to 20]","CVI techniques for infiltrating SiC into Nicalon fabrics. Work has 
concentrated on reducing processing times. Limited mechanical property 
data available. Pyrolytic graphite coating on fibres prevalent. There is a 
commercial link with Babcock & Wilcox. Proposed uses in heat exchangers, 
turbine engines & Space Power Systems (SDI)."
