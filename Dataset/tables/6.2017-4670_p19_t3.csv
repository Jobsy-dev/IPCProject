,"This initial chamber was proof tested after all welding, but several hot wall pinhole leaks were discovered at low"
pressures. The completed chamber and subsequent leaks can be seen in Figure 25. Initial EB weld setup demonstrated,
"that consistent depth of penetration could be maintained with room temperature welding operations. However, as the",
"copper heated up during welding of the full chamber, the depth of penetration increased by 2-3x that of the room",
temperature samples. The hot wall leaks were evident in the areas of the channels and not in the area of lands. This,
would support the increased penetration due to the increased heating of the material.,
