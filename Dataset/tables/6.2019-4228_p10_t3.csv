,The SLM process uses a layer-by-layer approach in which the desired component features are created by melting
the powder using a laser. SLM is being used for the fabrication of the GRCop materials described in this paper. The,
process starts with a 3D-CAD model that is sliced into thin 2D layers that are used to define the laser toolpath for,
"sintering the part. A thin layer, typically 50 microns or thinner, of metal powder is spread across the build area, and a",
"finely focused laser rasters to melt the area that defines the part cross-section at that particular layer17,18. A series of",
in-fill (internal) and contouring (inner and outer edges of part) scans are completed in a defined strategy that generally,
"minimizes incorporation of ejecta from the bed, hear build up and deformation of the parts and allows for 100%",
coverage of the 2D sliced layer.,
