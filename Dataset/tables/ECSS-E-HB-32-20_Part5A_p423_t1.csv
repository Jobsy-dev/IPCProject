"Jointing/
consolidation
technique",Advantages,Disadvantages
Fusion welding,Good for glass to metal,"Limited practical
combinations"
,Good for localised connections,"Inappropriate for large-area
joints"
,"Appropriate to similar
materials","Cannot accommodate
significant CTE differences"
"Liquid phase
bonding
- Brazing",Low pressure technique,Requires wettability
,"Allows use of brazes and frits
to achieve workable joints","Requires understanding of
chemical capabilities"
,,"Cannot accommodate
significant CTE differences"
"Diffusion
bonding
- with or
without
interlayer","Offers means of reducing
jointing temperature","Requires consolidation
pressure"
,"Interlayer gives better
accommodation of CTE
differences","Requires understanding of
diffusion mechanisms"
"Graded
structures","Offers means of
accommodating significant
differences in material CTE
and other properties, e.g.
modulus and conductivity","A sophisticated process
technique is to be used to
create a true transition zone"
,"Appropriate for joining
dissimilar materials",
