,Each liner was maintained in the same configuration and inspected after each test or set of cycles. The only time
a chamber was removed was to replace the O-ring seals as needed. Data from a long duration hotfire is shown in,
Figure 23. Performance remained stable during the mainstage testing. There were no observations of any pressure or,
"thermal variations within a test, and the measured parameters were very repeatable from test to test. Both liners",
successfully completed the test series with no issues. Cyclic testing data conducted on both liners is displayed in,
Figure 24. The test shown completed 7 cycles in a single test. The injector used for cyclic testing of both liners,
provided stable operation from cycle to cycle with no large amplitude combustion modes observed.,
