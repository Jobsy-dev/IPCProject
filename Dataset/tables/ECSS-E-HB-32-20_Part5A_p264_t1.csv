Manufacture,Consolidation,Notes
Nickel aluminides,,
"Ingot by conventional
casting in air, vacuum &
argon.
Melt spinning for rapid
solidification ribbons.
Spray or plasma deposition
for near-net shapes.
Conventional powder
metallurgy processes.
Reactive sintering.","Hot extrusion, if
canned.
HIP.
Difficult to hot work
due to low ductility at
high temperatures +
oxygen embrittlement.
Cold work + anneal.","Materials produced by
rapid solidification/powder
routes tend to have
significant levels of oxygen
(surface:volume effect)
compared with those
produced by conventional
casting. Material
embrittlement by residual
oxygen has been noted.
Rapidly work hardens."
Titanium aluminides,,
"Conventional casting (to
815kg ingot).
Conventional powder
metallurgy processes.
PREP powder route.
Melt spinning for rapidly
solidified ribbons.","Hot extrusion, if
canned.
HIP.
Hot pressing.","Wrought material
processing (rolling to thin
sheet and foil).
Sheet forming:
conventional &
superplastic forming."
Iron aluminides,,
"Conventional casting.
Powder metallurgy (also
ODS alloys).","Hot workable.
Hot extrusion.","These materials are
usually easier to fabricate."
