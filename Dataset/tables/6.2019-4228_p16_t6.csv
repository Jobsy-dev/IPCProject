,"NASA MSFC’s Test Stand (TS) 115 is ideal for testing quick turnaround subscale test articles, such as"
regeneratively-cooled channel wall nozzles and combustion chambers. The test rig has been successfully demonstrated,
through a variety of test campaigns and offers mainstage durations up to 210+ seconds and internal combustion,
temperatures up to 6000 °F. It has been successfully used for evaluation of a variety of channel-cooled and radiatively-,
"cooled nozzles and chambers since 2015, as well as for a variety of heritage tests dating back to the 1960’s. The",
thruster used on this test rig uses a simple coaxial injector supplied with liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (LOX/GH2),
to create high temperature environments. Various propellant combinations can be used depending upon the desired,
combustion environment.,
