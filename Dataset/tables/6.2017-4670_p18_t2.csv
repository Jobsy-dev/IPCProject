,The ports were each tapped manually using the port top surface as a primary datum and the outer circumference
as the secondary datum for centerline alignment. A lesson learned has been to set up the ports manually (individually),
for tapping instead of an automated computer numerical control (CNC) setup due to potential distortions from the,
build process. At this stage of fabrication small cracks were observed in the thinner regions of the ribs. These cracks,
"were likely due to several conditions: 1) A stress riser as an artifact of the design, 2) Microcracks during solidification",
"from the build, 3) A low cycle fatigue (LCF) or HCF condition present during the mallet blows from powder removal",
"and machining of the ports, and 4) Brittleness of the material prior to the HIP conditioning26. These cracks were",
monitored and saw some slight growth during continued powder removal operations.,
