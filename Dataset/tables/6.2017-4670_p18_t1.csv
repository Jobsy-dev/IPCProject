,The initial SLM build of the one-piece chamber was completed at the MSFC materials lab. This build used a mix
"of virgin and recycled GRCop-84 powder, although exact mixing was unknown. The total build time for the chamber",
"was approximately 14 days. Following completion of the build and removal from the build box, a start-stop knit line",
could be observed and also an area on the outer surface where some slight material curls were present. An initial,
attempt was made to remove powder from the chamber using a series of dead blows to the build plate and within,
thickened areas of the additive chamber. The chamber was then sent for Computer Tomography (CT) scanning to,
verify powder removal from the channels and manifolds. The first CT scan revealed a significant amount of powder,
"was present with >60% of the channels still blocked, as shown in Figure 24. It was determined the best method to",
continue with powder removal was to drill and tap the ports to allow for pressurized air to help with powder removal.,
The chamber remained on the build plate for this operation.,
