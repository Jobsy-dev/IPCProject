,"Following the port tapping, additional attempts were made at powder removal but continued to be a challenge."
There was no visible powder emanating from the chamber after continued rotation and mallet impacts. It was,
determined that the build plate would dampen the mallet blows and not much of that energy was being imparted into,
the areas needed. The chamber was then removed from the build plate with a band saw; the build plate removal would,
have typically been completed following HIP. Several attempts were made to remove the powder including high,
pressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2) purges in conjunction with mallet impacts. A fair amount of powder was observed,
"emanating from the part during these operations. However, an additional CT scan was run showing that 40% of the",
"channels were still blocked. Several more attempts were made at powder removal, and it was finally decided to cut a",
groove in the outer diameter (OD) to allow direct access to the channels.,
