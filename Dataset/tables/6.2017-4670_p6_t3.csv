,,"As can be seen in Figure 4, the LCF samples"
,initiated cracking on the rough interior surface at,
,multiple locations as expected. The cracks,
,appeared to grow in a manner consistent with prior,
,LCF testing of GRCop-84. The LCF lives of SLM,
,GRCop-84 are compared to results for prior LCF,
,testing of GRCop-84 consolidated by HIPing,
"using the same parameters as the SLM material in Figure 5. Not unexpectedly, the lives were reduced, but the",,
"reduction was relatively small, given the extremely rough interior surface. While not tested yet, it is likely that",,
conventional smooth LCF samples will have as good or better properties than the conventionally processed materials,,
tested previously.,,
