,A variety of copper-based alloys such as NARloy-Z (Cu-3 wt.% Ag-0.5 wt.% Zr) and C-18150 have been used for
combustion chambers in prior and current programs5. Development work of GRCop-84 under the LCUSP program,
has advanced additive manufacturing of GRCop-84. Work is ongoing with plans to hot fire test at least one such,
"section in the Fall of 2017 as discussed below, but some preliminary material properties have been generated on SLM",
processed GRCop-84 that indicate that the liners will have properties consistent with conventional wrought product,
tested under the Reusable Launch Vehicle - Second Generation (RLV 2nd Gen) program6.,
