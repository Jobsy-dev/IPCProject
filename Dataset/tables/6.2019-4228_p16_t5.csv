,An immediate goal of the GRCop-42 development was to complete hardware fabrication and hot-fire testing of
subscale combustion chambers to understand performance in a relevant environment. A standard slip-jacket chamber,
was baselined for the test program. A SLM GRCop-84 liner was previously tested in an identical configuration using,
various propellants and provided a good baseline for the GRCop-42 liner24. The goal of this GRCop-42 liner testing,
was to accumulate multiple duty cycles (high number of starts and seconds) to demonstrate the feasibility of the,
GRCop-42 material in a high heat flux environment. This testing was conducted at NASA MSFC Test Stand 115.,
