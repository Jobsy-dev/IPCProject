Natural oxide stripped before
coating
SiC cracked therefore not effective
Thermal shock:
SiC spalled
NiCr & Al did not spall
No metallurgical changes found with
Si3N4 coatings"
IMI829,Ti-8.5Si †,Sputtering,"Coating thickness 50 to 80m
typically
Coating polluted by Al
No significant diffusion between
coating/substrate at 700°C
Structural change in coating to Si-
rich phases
Coating reduced oxygen penetration
from 35 atomic% to 10 atomic%
uniformly"
