,The heat load effects due to varying chamber conditions was further examined during test. Keeping coolant flow
conditions similar allows for a better comparison of the different chamber conditions affecting heat load. Various,
"chamber configurations and test conditions ranging from 1,110 to 1,225 psia and MR of 4.96 to 8.01, as previously",
"mentioned, are included in Figure 25 and Figure 26.",
