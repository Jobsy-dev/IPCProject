,The hybrid additive slip jacket chamber completed hot-fire testing in November 2016 at MSFC TS115 using a
GRCop-84 liner. The chamber was hot-fire tested in the as-built condition with no post-processing of the internal,
coolant channels and minor machining of the external surfaces. The only machining completed on the external surfaces,
were mating surfaces. The surface finishes were acceptable in the as-built condition for this chamber configuration.,
"The GRCop-84 liner accumulated 2,365 seconds of hot-fire time and 23 starts. The chamber installed in the test stand",
can be seen in Figure 28 and hot-fire testing of this chamber seen in Figure 29. The chamber was removed from the,
test stand and inspected; no signs or erosion were observed and there was only slight discoloration near the injector.,
"Based on the condition of the liner, it will be used for additional testing at MSFC.",
