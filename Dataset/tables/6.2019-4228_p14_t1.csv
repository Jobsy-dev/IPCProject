,"Further mechanical characterization took place of the SLM GRCop-42, built using optimized parameters and"
"source powder, to compare with extruded and SLM GRCop-84 as well as extruded GRCop-42. This summary data",
can be seen in Table 3. The SLM samples all went through Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). Round tensile specimens,
were tested at MSFC in air at room temperature (70 ºF) to the ASTM E8 test standard22. Samples had a nominal gage,
diameter of 0.25” and a nominal reduced section length of 1.0”. The specimens were tested in displacement control at,
"an initial rate of 0.02 in/min. This rate was maintained up to 2% strain, then increased to a displacement rate of 0.05",
"in/min until failure occurred. Ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and fracture elongation values were determined",
from the resulting stress-strain curve according to procedures outlined in the ASTM E8 standard. The elongation of,
"the SLM GRCop-42 showed similar trends to the extruded GRCop-42. It also, as expected, showed higher elongation",
than the SLM GRCop-84.,
