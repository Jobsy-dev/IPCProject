Process,Problem,Comments
"Powder
production",High oxygen levels,"Process in vacuum & inert
gas. Acceptable levels now
100 ppm."
Powder forging,-,"Improved mechanical
properties."
"Extruded
powder billet",-,"Fine grain size &
superplasticity."
"Hot isostatic
pressing (HIP)
†","Limited deformation &
recrystallisation","Alloy modified to fine tune C
content and carbide
stabilisers (Nb, Ta, Hf) for
HIP alloys."
,"Prior particle boundaries
not eliminated",Improved if HIPped
,Exogenous defects,-
,"Porosity in SC alloys act as
initiators for fatigue cracks.",-
Key: † Potential cost reduction of 35 to 40% for turbine blades.,,
