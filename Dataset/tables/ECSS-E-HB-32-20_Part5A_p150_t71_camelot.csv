"Hydrogen embrittlement 
(HE) mechanism","Absorption of hydrogen at ~90 
to 150ppm causes hydride 
precipitation.","For Ti-10V-2Fe: Linked to -
phase stabilisation inhibiting 
martensite transformation."
Cryogenic Temperatures,Resistance to liquid hydrogen.,"Insufficient heat to promote 
dissociation at 20K"
Ambient to ~400C,"Erratic behaviour, not easily 
predicted. Factors include: 
 Oxide-free surface 
 Stress 
 Acicular microstructure 
 Increasing temperature 
 Increasing pressure 
Intact oxide films (without 
other active factors) reduce 
hydrogen penetration below 
~450C.","R
Turbine blades operating at 
350C found to chip in 
stressed regions (leading 
edge) owing to high hydrogen 
contents. 
educe hydrogen content by 
vacuum heat-treatment (700
C for 7 hours, typically)."
>450C,Sensitive to hydrogen,
Surface contamination,"Fe & Fe-Ni surface 
contamination prohibits 
formation of Ti oxide film. 
These are sites for rapid 
hydrogen penetration & 
embrittlement of the alloy.","Ti structures fabricated with 
Fe-based tooling require: 
 Surface pickling to 
remove contamination. 
 Use of Ti brushes for 
scratch-brushing 
operations."
