,As the required chamber length exceeded the build box dimensions of the SLM machine utilized for fabrication of
"these parts, a method of joining the two chamber halves had to be developed. An EB weld was selected, as the parts",
would be in LaRC’s EBF3 machine for deposition. The LaRC developed process parameters for the EB weld of SLM,
GRCop-84 and demonstrated it on SLM trial rings as shown in Figure 14. This also resulted in process efficiencies,
"as the parts were then already on the mandrel and ready for the next phase, Inconel jacket deposition, as soon as the",
"EB beam weld was complete at the halves. While the initial attempt on this joint was successful, in order to further",
ease fabrication the joint has been further refined to create a continuous copper alloy substrate for the Inconel,
deposition.,
