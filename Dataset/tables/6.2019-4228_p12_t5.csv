,The average tensile strength and elongation values from lots tested are shown below in Table 2 with various vendor
powder lots and mesh sizes. A minimum of 30% elongation was the target for process development and strength met,
"the requirements for designers. Only one powder lot met that criterion, but three others were above 20% elongation.",
