,"Finally, CT scans in comparison to the model geometry were found to be very useful for disposition discrepancies."
"On demonstrator unit, it was evident that some EBF3 Inconel 625 had collected in the region of the coolant passage",
"inlets and outlets, but external visual inspections were indeterminate as to whether the passages were blocked. CT",
scans were taken. Overlaying these scans with the model served to orient the viewer as to what the CT slice in that,
"region should look like. When coolant passages are built in to the part and turn back to allow for manifolding, it",
creates some potentially confusing slices that contain multiple sets of passages. The overlay of the model showed that,
