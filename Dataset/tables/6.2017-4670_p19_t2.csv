,The chamber was sent for a HIP cycle. A split ring was machined to match the groove to closeout the channels.
The ring was machined from GRCop-84 billet stock as a cylinder and then electro-discharge machined (EDM) to,
provide the split. The first ring was fit for welding and observed to have a significant gap. A visual and caliper,
"inspection revealed that the initial groove, cut prior to HIP, had deformed slightly after the HIP, causing the gap. The",
OD groove on the chamber was skim cut on both sides on the lathe and a second split ring manufactured to precisely,
fit.,
,The split ring was EB welded using a root penetration pass and a secondary cosmetic EB final pass. Initial
"development work demonstrated approximately the appropriate depth of penetration for the chamber weld, which",
required elevated EB weld parameters as typical with copper. The axial splits in the split ring were also initially EB,
welded and then cleaned up using a manual tungsten inert gas (TIG) repair. Several new cracks were also observed,
following the HIP cycle in the same location of the flange support ribs. Some of the cracks were observed in the area,
of one of the forward end outlet ports. All of these cracks were repaired using TIG and compatible filler material.,
