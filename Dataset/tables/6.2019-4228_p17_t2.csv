,The thrust chamber assembly used a PBF additively manufactured coaxial injector and the SLM GRCop-42
combustion chamber liner30. The injector was previously tested and characterized under several similar test,
"programs31,32. The chamber configuration was also previously demonstrated with a slip-jacket liner. The slip-jacket",
liner design shown in Figure 20 allows for quick change-over of the various liners33. The chambers were water cooled,
for both test series.,
