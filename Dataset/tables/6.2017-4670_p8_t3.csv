,"Under LCUSP, AM technologies in SLM GRCop-84 and EBF3 Inconel 625 have been significantly advanced. In"
"general, properties are in family with traditionally manufactured GRCop-84 with the exception of High Cycle Fatigue",
(HCF) life as previously described. This reduction in life is likely due to the inherent surface roughness of the SLM,
"process, and it is believed that in applications where surface finishing operations can be applied, this life would be",
"comparable to traditional GRCop-84, as well. Sections for a fully printed 2-piece chamber are shown in Figure 8, and",
the LCUSP unit that is planned for hot-fire testing is shown in Figure 7b.,
