comparison to SLM GRCop-84 is also shown. The SLM tensile data follows similar trends to the extruded material,
shown previously. The SLM GRCop-42 samples demonstrated higher elongation compared to the extruded material.,
,"The SLM material in the as-built (non-HIP) condition exhibits high residual stresses and higher strength, but the"
elongation is significantly reduced23. An example of tensile data of SLM GRCop-42 showing very little scatter and,
consistent properties can be seen in Figure 18.,
