,"Sustained peak wall temperatures were demonstrated up to 1,340 °F on the SLM GRCop-42 liners. The chamber"
liners performed well under varied test conditions. The data gathered also showed the resilience of the material at,
these elevated wall temperatures with consistent performance throughout the test series. The hot-fire testing,
"demonstrated aggressive conditions with high Pc, MC and subsequent heat loads. The chambers were run aggressively",
"to promote the environment for potential blanching, but none was observed in the liners.",
