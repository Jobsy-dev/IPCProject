Conditions,Characteristic
Static,"Freshly exposed Ti surface in contact with oxygen causes
ignition."
,"Reaction is dependent on oxygen content and pressure, the
lower the O content, the higher the pressure needed.
2"
,"Pure O static conditions pressure of ~2.5MPa required.
2"
,"Affected by purity of O atmosphere.
2
At O concentrations <~47%, ignition does not occur.
2"
,"Ignition limits are not influenced by surface to volume ratio or
by temperatures up to ~300°C."
Dynamic,Increased possibility of ignition
,Limited to oxygen concentration < 35%.
,Ignition will not occur in air.
,Ignition is not self sustaining in water or aqueous solution.
,"Ignition may occur in vapour space above solution, if
conditions are favourable."
