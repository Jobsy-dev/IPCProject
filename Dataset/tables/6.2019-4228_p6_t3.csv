,"In a regeneratively cooled engine, high-pressure fuel is passed through cooling channels to cool the liner. A"
chamber hotwall is designed relatively thin to minimize the thermal gradient and minimize hotwall peak temperatures.,
"With operating pressures up to 6 ksi (41 MPa), large stresses can be generated in these thin walls. The higher the",
"strength of the material, the thinner that the hot wall can be made without failing. While current designs generally use",
"sufficiently thick walls that the difference in material strengths is not a driving issue, features possible with additive",
manufacturing may result in thinner walls and possibly a strength-limited design.,
