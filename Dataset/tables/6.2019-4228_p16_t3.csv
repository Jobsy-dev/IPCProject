,"As part of the material process development and characterization, samples were created to demonstrate the ability"
to create identical geometry to that shown in GRCop-84 with internal features. This included maximum and minium,
"build features, angles and internal geometry. These samples (example shown in Figure 19) showed similar build",
"limitations one would expect with typical SLM rules of design. Following the material process development,",
"development components were fabricated for lab and hot-fire testing, which will be discussed in the next section.",
