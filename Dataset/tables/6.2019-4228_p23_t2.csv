,NASA is continuing to advance the PBF GRCop-42 development in the GE Concept Laser M2- and EOS M290-
"scale SLM machines. In addition, NASA is seeking to develop larger liners using larger build platform such as the",
EOS M400. Increased build volume allows for full scale combustion chambers to be printed in a single piece for,
"upper-stage and boost class engine applications. Aside from the internal NASA development work, several vendors",
are providing GRCop-42 as a commercial printing service. Some of these initial properties from these vendors were,
shown in this paper.,
