,Additional mechanical test samples are continually being produced to add to the data shown above. These samples
are fabricated as independent builds and as witness specimens to component builds. One of the concerns during,
development was transferring parameters to different machines and scales would not be possible. Similar parameters,
"were used when transferring to other systems or scaling, although some adjustments were made on different machines",
"based on the laser systems. Overall, the properties are very similar though. The average tensile curves at RT (70°F)",
for the SLM GRCop-42 built on the MSFC Concept M2 and a vendor’s EOS M400 are shown in Figure 17. A,
