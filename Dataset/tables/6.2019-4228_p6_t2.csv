,"This difference in thermal expansions implies that, at a given hot wall temperature, the GRCop-42 will have a"
"higher LCF strain and hence lower life. This is counterbalanced by the higher thermal conductivity that will, for the",
"same operating conditions, result in a lower hot wall temperature. There needs to be an iterative analysis to select",
optimal operating conditions and which alloy is best for a given application.,
