,Figure 1 shows the thermal conductivity of extruded GRCop-42 and GRCop-84. During the Second Generation
"RLV program, it was discovered that the 200-250 ppm Fe contamination from the Cr melt stock had a dramatic effect",
upon the thermal conductivity of GRCop-8413. Data from both the low (<50 ppm) and high Fe versions are shown to,
demonstrate the effect. The GRCop-42 tested did not benefit from this change and had approximately 100-125 ppm,
"Fe. To a first approximation, the thermal conductivity of the newer, lower Fe additive manufacturing powders should",
