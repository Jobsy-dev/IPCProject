,Figure 6 through Figure 9 compare the tensile mechanical properties of wrought GRCop-42 and GRCop-84. At
"lower temperatures, mainly below 600 °C (1112 °F), GRCop-84 is clearly stronger than GRCop-42. This is one of",
the major properties that must be decreased for the higher thermal conductivity offered by GRCop-42. For a given,
"operating pressure, the minimum wall thickness of a liner must be increased to lower the stresses to acceptable levels.",
"How that affects thermal gradients, hot wall temperatures, thermally induced strains and other design considerations",
must be examined and likely requires iterations to determine optimal designs in strength limited applications.,
