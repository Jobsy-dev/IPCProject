both Liner #1 and #2 and shown in Figure 27. It is believed that the ash products from TEA-TEB combustion were
the source of the reduction in measured heat load. Chamber conditions were adjusted to provide a higher heat flux
"environment, and the heat load measured showed repeatable data on Liner #1 following the initial TEA ash build up"
on the liner after 17 tests. The test conditions used on Liner #1 during the spark ignition phase resulted in some of the
highest heat loads recorded.
