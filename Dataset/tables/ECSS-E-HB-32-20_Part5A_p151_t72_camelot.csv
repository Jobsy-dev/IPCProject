Conditions,Characteristic
Static,"Freshly exposed Ti surface in contact with oxygen causes 
ignition."
,"Reaction is dependent on oxygen content and pressure, the 
lower the O2 content, the higher the pressure needed."
,Pure O2 static conditions pressure of ~2.5MPa required.
,"Affected by purity of O2 atmosphere.  
At O2 concentrations <~47%, ignition does not occur."
,"Ignition limits are not influenced by surface to volume ratio or 
by temperatures up to ~300°C."
Dynamic,Increased possibility of ignition
,Limited to oxygen concentration < 35%.
,Ignition will not occur in air.
,Ignition is not self sustaining in water or aqueous solution.
,"Ignition may occur in vapour space above solution, if 
conditions are favourable."
