,This unit required multiple print attempts and design changes were made after each to produce a successful
"part. Figure 18 shows the unit on its build plate. In early attempts, printing failed in the open volume of the inlet",
manifold. The open volume had to be reshaped with proper angles and varying support features to achieve success.,
"Similar angles were included in the exit manifold volume. Also in the upper portion of the chamber, additional",
material had to be printed in to properly support the upper edge.,
