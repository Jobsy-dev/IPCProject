,Background and Overview of Extruded GRCop-42
,Work on Cu-Cr-Nb alloys began under the NASA CSTI Earth-To-Orbit Propulsion and NASA Graduate
Fellowship Programs in 1987. A series of alloys with 2-10 at.% Cr and 1-5% Nb with a Cr to Nb atomic ratio of 2:1,
were examined by producing and testing chill block melt spun ribbons12. Based upon the observed strengths and,
"conductivities, two alloys were selected for further development – Cu-8 at.% Cr-4 at.% Nb (GRCop-84) and Cu-4",
at.% Cr-2 at.% Nb (GRCop-42). The alloys were scaled up using inert atmosphere powder atomization to produce,
useful quantities of material that could be processed using conventional powder metallurgy techniques.,
