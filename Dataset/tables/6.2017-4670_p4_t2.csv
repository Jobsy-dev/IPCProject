,"GRCop and GlidCop, two alloys that have been considered for rocket engines in the past7, have the unique problem"
"that both are dispersion strengthened by a high melting point phase, Cr Nb and Al O , respectively. Both of these
2 2 3",
phases are less dense than copper and could float to the surface of the melt pool and segregate during SLM processing.,
Neither will be melted during normal SLM processing where the temperature of the melt pool is likely only a bit above,
the melting point of copper.,
