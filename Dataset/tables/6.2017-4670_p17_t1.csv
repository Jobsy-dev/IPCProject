,"A 1.2K-lb thrust LOX/H2 chamber was designed to replace a heritage chamber (vintage 1960’s design) for use as
f"
"a new workhorse unit for MSFC TS115 subscale component testing. Due to the overall size of this chamber, it was a",
prime candidate to use the AM GRCop-84 process. The chamber was designed as an integral one-piece unit to fit,
within the standard 250x250x250mm build boxes for the Concept Laser M2 at MSFC and various vendors. The size,
of this hardware was also ideal for lower-cost fabrication and validation through hot-fire testing. A series of these,
workhorse chambers were designed that allowed for varying configurations as the process was being developed and,
"lessons learned. The development 3D printed chambers included: 1) One-piece combustion chambers, 2) Two-piece",
"chambers, 3) bimetallic chambers and, 4) Slip-Jacket chambers. The objectives of these chambers were to allow",
iterations of design changes while understanding the process and minimize test cost to prove the technology in a,
relevant environment.,
