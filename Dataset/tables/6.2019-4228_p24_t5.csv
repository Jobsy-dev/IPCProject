,NASA is continuing to advance the technology for AM GRCop-42 combustion chambers. Several vendors are
being established to provide GRCop-42 as a commercial printing service and NASA is using vendor-supplied,
chambers as part of development testing under the RAMPT program. NASA recently demonstrated large-scale PBF,
of GRCop-42 material in a EOS M400 and achieved properties consistent with the Concept Laser M2 material. Several,
large-scale chambers have been fabricated and will be tested in the future. Mechanical and thermophysical property,
testing of the SLM GRCop-42 is being completed to develop a design database and disseminate data to industry,
partners and general industry.,
