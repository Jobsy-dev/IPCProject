,"In general, the two most important properties for selecting an alloy for a combustion chamber liner are thermal"
"conductivity and low cycle fatigue (LCF) resistance. While other material attributes are certainly important, these",
dominate. High thermal conductivity is needed to minimize both the hot wall temperature and thermal gradient through,
the liner wall. LCF occurs during repeated hot firings of the engine during qualification and flight. Depending upon,
"the engine type and mission, anywhere from tens to hundreds of cycles may be accumulated over the life of an engine.",
"Typically, thermal expansion of the constrained liner causes a deformation of 1% or more. This can result in a rapid",
degradation of the liner and ultimately failure.,
