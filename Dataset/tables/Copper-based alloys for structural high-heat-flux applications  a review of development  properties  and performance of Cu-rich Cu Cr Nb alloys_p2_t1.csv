GRCop-84, and Cu–4Cr–2Nb, or GRCop-42. Recent additive manufacturing efforts have
increased interest in GRCop alloys, and full-scale hardware has been fabricated using AM
techniques and practical hot-fire tests have been conducted, but structure–property
relationships are still under development. The development, processing, and current
microstructure-property relationships of GRCop alloys are reviewed along with comparisons
to similar high-heat-flux Cu alloys including NARloy-Z, GlidCop Al-15, AMZIRC, Cu–1Cr–0.1Zr,
andCu–0.9Cr.ThereviewconcludeswithanassessmentoffutureprospectsforGRCopalloys
