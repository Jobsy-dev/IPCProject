,Figure 10 compares the creep rates for wrought GRCop-42 and GRCop-84. The results for the GRCop-84 are for
warm rolled plate rather than as-extruded material because the data set was comparable to the as-extruded material,
but had less variability caused by a testing issue discovered post-test. The analysis with the as-extruded material,
resulted in the same conclusion but with less power in the statistical analysis. The conclusion was that the creep rates,
of the two alloys were very similar but did have some statistically significant differences. When such a statistical,
"difference was noted, it was very small and likely reflected the power of the analysis to discern small statistical",
"differences rather than a practical difference. In example, the rate or life might change 0.1 to 0.3 orders of magnitude",
