,The SLM development work supports NASA projects
including Engine Advanced Manufacturing for MSFC’s,
"Liquid Engines Office (LEO), the RAMPT project,",
"Lunar Lander applications, Nuclear Thermal Propulsion,",
and NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate,
(STMD) Announcement for Collaborative Opportunity,
(ACO) program with commercial space partners. Several,
of these projects are making use of the current scale and,
evaluating the larger scale. NASA will complete,
hardware fabrication and hot-fire testing of the larger,
GRCop-42 chambers in early 2020. Investments are,
being made by NASA in the material characterization,
and property database to further enable the technology,
readiness and process maturity. Test samples from the,
"existing scale build platforms (M2, and M290) and the",
EOS M400 will complete a series of mechanical and,
thermophysical property testing to develop a design,
database for the SLM GRCop-42 and GRCop-84. This,
data is being tested continuously and will be made,
available to industry partners and general industry.,
