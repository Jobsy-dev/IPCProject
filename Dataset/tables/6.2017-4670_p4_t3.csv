,"Finally, SLM processing leaves a surface finish roughly equivalent to the diameter of the powder used. Typically"
a powder cut in the -325 mesh (<40 micron) range is used for SLM. Using the powder diameter as an approximation,
"of the surface finish, the as built surface would have the rough equivalent of a 63 microinch machined surface. While",
"the exposed surfaces can be machined to a smoother finish, it is very difficult and more likely impossible to machine",
the interior cooling channels of liners and other SLM parts. The rough surface will increase turbulent flow during,
engine operation. This will increase the pressure drop but also increase the heat transfer to the coolant. Whether the,
increased benefits of greater heat transfer outweigh the increased pressure drop are likely going to be specific to each,
"design, but designers do need to address the issue.",
