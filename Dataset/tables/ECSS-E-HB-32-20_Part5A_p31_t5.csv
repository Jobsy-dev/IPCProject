,Basic temper designations,,,,
F,,"As fabricated. Products for which there
are no special thermal or strain
hardening processes.",H,"Strain hardened. For wrought products which are
strengthened by working, with or without thermal
treatments. The H is always followed by one or
more further digits.",
O,,"Annealed. Used for cast products to
improve ductility or dimensional
stability and for wrought products to
give lowest strength.",T,"Thermally treated to stable temper other than F, O
or H. Used for products thermally treated with or
without strain hardening. The T is always followed
by one or more further digits.",
W,,"Solution heat treated. Unstable temper,
used only for alloys which
spontaneously age harden at room
temperature.",,"NOTE: The letter P can be used, after the temper
designation, to indicate variations to H, T or O
tempers agreed between supplier and purchaser.",
