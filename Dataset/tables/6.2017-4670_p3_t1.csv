,SLM offers a new approach to fabricate pre-closeout coolant passages and makes alternate processes viable for
"creating a structural jacket, and these new processes can significantly reduce fabrication costs and schedules. For",
"nozzles, additive techniques such as SLM, directed energy deposition (DED) and direct metal deposition (DMD) offer",
the opportunity to “print” one-piece units. NASA has been investigating several of the new AM techniques to,
determine their viability and to better understand the available savings offered. These techniques include:,
