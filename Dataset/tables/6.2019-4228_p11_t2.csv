,"While the GRCop-84 development had been successful on a 30 micron step print strategy, it proved to be time-"
"consuming to build larger components at that rate—essentially a 10.8” (274320 microns or 9,144 layers) tall part could",
take as long as 28 days to fabricate using PBF. The intent with the GRCop-42 development was that it could be pushed,
to operate at faster print speeds and scaled to larger platform PBF machines (i.e. EOS M400) to allow production for,
larger scale components. The higher conductivity of the GRCop-42 was theorized to allow for lower core energy,
"density (CED), thus achieving stable weld pools at thicker layers. This effort started with 50% thicker layers (45",
microns). This strategy appeared to be successful and thicker layers were baselined for the GRCop-42.,
