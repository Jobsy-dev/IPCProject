,It was observed that SLM tensile values were lower than desired in the samples that did not include the fine
particles. The elongation was one of the driving properties since this is important in the thermal cycling of a,
combustion chamber. The baseline for all production powder lots is to include the fine particles and limit the maximum,
diameter of the powder to 45 µm.,
