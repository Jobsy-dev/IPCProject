,These new workhorse chambers were designed to meet chamber pressure up to 1100 psia and a range of MR
"requirements, in addition to 2000 psig coolant pressure for both water-cooling and gaseous hydrogen cooling. The",
"nozzle contour aft of the throat was modified for full expansion of the flow to allow for longer nozzles to be tested,",
such as composite nozzle extensions and regeneratively-cooled channel wall nozzles23. The channels were optimized,
to minimize wall temperatures with pressure drop being a secondary consideration since it is used as a development,
workhorse unit. This enabled a rapid design process and minimized material for additive manufacturing. The baseline,
"SLM chamber design channels had varying cross sectional area in the barrel, throat and nozzle sections. The SLM",
design allowed a smooth transition design between varying aspect ratios to minimize pressure drop in these regions.,
A constant hot wall thickness was maintained. The maximum wall temperatures are shown in Figure 22 and they are,
within previous test experience for the GRCop-84 material24.,
