due to permeable ceramic layer."
"Key:  Fully‐stabilised Zirconia has poor thermal shock performance.
 A very rough ceramic/bond coat interface may cause a higher stress state in the ceramic
leading to premature failure by cracking adjacent to the interface.
 Annealing may cause a slight increase in Thermal Conductivity, depending on ceramic
composition.
 Differences in CTE between the bond coat and ceramic tend to cause cracking adjacent to their
interface.
 Cracking allows accommodation of thermal fatigue stresses.",
