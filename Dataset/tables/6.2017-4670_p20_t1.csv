,"Although this one-piece chamber was not tested, it provided several lessons learned during the design and"
development of AM GRCop-84-based combustion chambers. Several features have been modified to mitigate,
potential cracking during builds or during post-processing operations. Welding operations for the GRCop-84 were,
also developed that allows for future chambers to be welded using EB or TIG. Other design approaches were also,
learned during this one-piece chamber to aid with powder removal and other post-processing to reduce overall,
development cycle time.,
