Multidirectional CFRP,Modest,1 to 2,"Well understood technology. Costs
reducing through automation &
lower part counts over aluminium."
"Wrought Magnesium
Alloys","Low to
Modest",1 to 2,"Well understood technology. Fewer
applications than aluminium."
"7XXX series Wrought
Aluminium Alloys",Low,1,"Well understood technology applied
to ambient temperature structures."
"8090 Aluminium-
Lithium Alloy","Modest to
Medium",1 to 3,"Technology established for 5 years.
Requires more usage to increase
confidence."
Aluminium ODS Alloy,Medium,2 to 3,"Improves high temperature
capabilities of 7XXX series, but
lacks applications."
"Carbon Fibre
Reinforced Aluminium
Alloy","Medium to
High",2 to 4,"Lacks applications. Some
fundamental issues still to be
resolved, e.g. poor transverse
strength & corrosion."
"Wrought Titanium
Alloy",Medium,1 to 2,"Well established technology for
intermediate temperature (200° to
600°C) applications."
"Silicon Carbide Mono-
filament Reinforced
Titanium",High,3 to 5,"Still under development. Seeking
applications principally in gas
turbine engines."
"Conventional Nickel
Superalloy",Medium,2,"Well established technology
particularly for gas turbine engines."
"Consolidated Titanium
Aluminide","Medium to
High",3 to 5,"Still under development. Competing
for gas turbine use."
Machined Beryllium,"Medium to
High",2 to 3,"Specialised high modulus material,
but has established history. Lack in
confidence on low ductility/toxicity
has hindered use."
"Ceramic Matrix

High",6 to 9,"Recent development for very high
temperature applications.
Processing is specialised & capital
intensive. Lower processing costs
sought."
"Hot Pressed Glass-

Composite: LAS/SiC",Very High,5 to 7,"Easier to achieve than CMC's, but
are restrained to 1000°C"
"Carbon-Carbon
Composite","High to Very
High",4 to 5,"Well established technology,
although cost and poor oxidation
performance can limit application."
"Key: † Based on cost‐to‐weight. However, variations in density are enormous from 1740 kg/m3
(Magnesium) to 9500 kg/m3 (Superalloys).
‡ Ranking to reflect:‐
∙ Technical difficulty
∙ Availability of knowledge & facilities, and
∙ Material cost
1 = Easily achieved; 10 = Extremely difficult.",,,
