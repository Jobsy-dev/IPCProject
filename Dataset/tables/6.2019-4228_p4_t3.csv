,"The plastic strain was also measured during the tests. As can be seen in Figure 3, wrought GRCop-42 has a similar"
"amount of plastic deformation as wrought GRCop-84. A comparatively large scatter was observed for both alloys,",
and it is unclear if this is a truly significant difference. The results do indicate that permanent plastic deformation,
due to LCF in a liner made of GRCop-42 will be similar to one made from GRCop-84.,
