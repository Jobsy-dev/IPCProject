,Builds of SLM GRCop-42 were setup to document how mechanical properties were affected by a variety of power
"and scan speed build parameters. On a single build plate, 25 test specimens were built using a power and scan speeds",
from “low and slow” to “high and fast”. The range was limited to conditions shown in prior experiments to offer,
"acceptable density and pore size values. As shown in Figure 16, the UTS, yield, and elongation values were very",
consistent and fell within an acceptable range for liner applications.,
