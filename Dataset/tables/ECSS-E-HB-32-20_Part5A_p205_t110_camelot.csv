Chromising,,,,
"Diffusion of Cr into substrate 
forming chromium oxide on 
exposure.","Low alloy steels in 
industrial & marine gas 
turbines.","Resistance to low 
temperature sulphidation 
corrosion. 
Temperature range 973 to 
1023K.","Chromia scales worse than 
alumina scales at >1123K in high 
velocity gas-streams.","Owing to volatility of 
chromium oxide."
Aluminising : Low and high activity pack,,,,
"Diffusion of Al into substrate 
forming NiAl coat (Ni-based 
substrate) or CoAl coat (Co-
based substrate). Forming 
Al2O3  on exposure.","Ni-based & Co-based 
super-alloys in aero-
engines (industrial/ 
marine gas turbines).","Inexpensive. 
Easy to apply and strip 
during overhaul. 
Proprietary coating media 
'Packs' available. 
Ability to form & replenish 
Al203 scale.","Used where metal 
temperatures/environment not 
severe. 
Brittle. 
In exacting conditions, coating 
may crack due to rapid thermal 
cycling & allow substrate 
corrosion. 
Poor thermal fatigue.","Extensively used 
satisfying ~90% of 
applications. 
High DuctileBrittle 
transition temperature. 
Coating thickness 50m 
typ."
Platinum aluminide,,,,
"Diffusion as above of Pt into 
coating & substrate.  
Exact coat composition depends 
on proprietary process.",As above.,"Proprietary coating media 
'Packs' available. 
Extensive aero-engine 
service. 
Good high temperature hot 
corrosion (Type I) resistance.","Susceptible to low temperature hot 
corrosion.   (Type II)","Platinum deposited prior 
to aluminising."
Selective oxidation,,,,
"Controlled oxidation of 
substrate to form more stable 
oxides.","Superalloys with 
sufficient levels of Cr & 
Al.","Controlled oxidation of 
substrate.  
No second phase added to 
surface.","Modest oxidation-corrosion 
resistance. 
Poor Adhesion. 
Seldom solely Al2O3  formed (due 
to substrate).","Not appropriate for high 
temperature applications 
(oxide stability)."
