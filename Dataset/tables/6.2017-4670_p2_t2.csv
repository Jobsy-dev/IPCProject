A,dditive Manufacturing (AM) technologies continue to evolve and mature creating opportunities for application
,to liquid rocket propulsion systems. Several new individual techniques and combinations of techniques appear
to offer options to mitigate production time and significantly reduce cost and schedule in liquid rocket chambers and,
"nozzles, if the enabling technology challenges can be solved. Specifically, high pressure/high temperature combustion",
"chambers and nozzles must be regeneratively (regen) cooled to survive their operating environment, causing their",
"design fabrication to be costly and time consuming, due to the number of individual steps and different processes",
required. Traditional cooled chambers and nozzles require either the closeout of milled passages or the bonding of,
tubes together. AM offers the design and fabrication options not previously possible with other manufacturing,
techniques including complex internal and integral design features. This allows for an overall reduction in the,
"assembly and elimination of joints. Additive manufacturing is not a process that will replace all traditional processes,",
"but it does provide significant advantages, and NASA is exploring the use of AM for chambers and nozzles through",
"design, development and hot-fire testing.",
