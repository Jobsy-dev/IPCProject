,A technique utilizing the combination of structured light scanning with CT information and the design model were
"utilized together proved very valuable in these additive processes, as well. Figure 16 shows how the structured light",
"scan, the CT scan, and the model can be overlaid to provide a rapid assessment of both the external feature",
characteristics of the AM part as well as the internal feature characteristics as compared to the model also. In Figure,
16 it can be seen that the inside of the manifold contours did not match the curve of the design. This information can,
be utilized to estimate knock-down factors for use in revised structural modeling of the as-built geometry.,
