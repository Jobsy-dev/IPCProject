,Room tensile testing was conducted on a limited number of as-built specimens and samples that underwent a Hot
Isostatic Pressing (HIPing or HIP) to close the fine porosity in the samples. The HIPing temperature was well above,
the normal 600 °C (1112 °F) annealing temperature of GRCop-84. The average stress-strain curves are shown in,
