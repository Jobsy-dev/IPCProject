,"Shown in Figure 17, the coolant channels were printed into this first GRCop-84 design, so that no separate"
"closeout layer was required. Since the operating pressures were low enough, this unit did not require a separate",
structural jacket – the thickness of the copper was sufficient for containing pressure. The design included unique,
features to gather discrete data for evaluating performance and anchoring thermal models for methane cooled systems.,
"Additional printed features included the inlet and exit manifold volumes, along with an inlet boss for a threaded",
"interface. The only welding required was to attach the forward flange. This flange, which provided the bolt hole",
"pattern to mate the chamber with adjacent hardware, had to be welded on since its diameter would not fit in the print",
volume available with the Concept Laser M2 unit at MSFC. The only machining required was tapping threads for,
each port and polishing for the mating seal surface.,
