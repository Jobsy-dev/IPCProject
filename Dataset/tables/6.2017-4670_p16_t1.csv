"the GRCop-84 chamber at high mixture ratio (MR) conditions, and the chamber remained well overcooled, showing"
high performance margins for potential throttle conditions. The results for this initial META4 chamber were used to
"determine design changes required for the second unit to make fabrication and assembly efforts easier, while still"
maintaining high performance. The second META4 chamber unit is expected to be completed and available for testing
at MSFC in October 2017.
