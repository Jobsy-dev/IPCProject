Reinforcement,"Recrystallisation temperature of W reduced by: Ni, Al & Mn.
Reaction of W with matrix."
Matrix,"Formation of intermetallic and/or carbide compounds in
proximity of fibre, reducing composite integrity."
"Iron-based
superalloys","Lower solubility of W in Fe, compared with Ni.
Less active in promoting W recrystallisation.
Fe-W intermetallics are more stable at high temperatures
than W-Ni compounds."
FeCrAlY,"High oxidation resistance
High melting point
Compatible with W"
