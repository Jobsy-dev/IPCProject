,"The SLM GRCop-42 process parameter development yielded the initial density, mechanical properties, thermal"
"conductivity, and surface finishes desired. The SLM GRCop-42 process parameters also resulted in a 20% reduction",
in processing time compared to the SLM GRCop-84 parameters. MSFC and GRC demonstrated that GRCop-42 is a,
readily printable alloy that can be additively manufactured into fully dense components with consistent properties at,
"higher throughput rates than its predecessor, GRCop-84.",
