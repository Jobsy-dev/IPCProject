,Two SLM GRCop-42 chambers were hot-fire tested at MSFC Test Stand 115 to demonstrate long durations and
"high duty cycle of the material at >2K-lb thrust. These chamber liners were fabricated on the MSFC Concept Laser
f",
M2 and tested in a similar configuration to prior SLM GRCop-84 chamber liners. A total of 188 tests were completed,
"on the two GRCop-42 liners and accumulated a combined 8,030 seconds of test time. The conditions included chamber",
"pressures (Pc) up to 1,224 psig and mixture ratios (MR) up to 8.01. The first SLM GRCop-42 liner completed a total",
"of 168 tests and accumulated 7,400 seconds. No signs of blanching or degradation were observed, and the liner",
remained in excellent condition. The second liner had a total of 20 starts and 630 sec hot-fire time with a MR up to,
8.01.NASA also demonstrated the ability to conduct 7 cycles per hot-fire test to accumulate significant starts and time,
on hardware.,
