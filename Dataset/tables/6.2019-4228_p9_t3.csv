,The lack of major differences in the creep properties likely reflects the pure Cu matrix dominating the creep of the
alloys. Precipitates on the grain boundaries prevented grain boundary slip and grain growth and may have reduced,
"grain boundary diffusion. It appears that even GRCop-42, with 7 vol.% Cr Nb, has a sufficient amount of precipitates

to give good creep properties.,
