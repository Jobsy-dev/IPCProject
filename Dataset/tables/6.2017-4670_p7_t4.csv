,The benefits of SLM processing may extend to some other additive manufacturing processes. Electron Beam
"Melting (EBM), which also has a turbulent melt pool, likely will have similar results. Other processes such as binder",
"jet printing where there is no mechanism to refine the Cr Nb particles will likely not result in improved properties.
