Phenomenon,Characteristics
Hydrogen attack,Occurs at high temperature.
,"Formation of a reaction product between hydrogen & 
alloying element, e.g. H2 + C methane, in steels."
,"Both reactants diffuse to an internal interface to combine 
& form a cavity."
,"Continued reaction produces high pressure gas pockets 
inside material."
"Internal hydrogen 
pressure","Occurs at RT, or below, plus high temperatures."
,"Diffusion of protonic hydrogen through material to 
interface."
,Depends on a supersaturation level.
,"Reacts to form high pressure molecular H2 gas pockets 
inside material."
,Molecular hydrogen is largely immobile.
"Dislocation 
interaction",Wide temperature range.
,Does not require super saturation of protonic H.
,Strongly influences plastic behaviour.
Hydride formation,Protonic hydrogen levels above saturation.
,Reacts to form a brittle metal hydride.
,"Hydrides precipitate at selected planes and local regions 
of high strain."
