,It has been noted in the past that GRCop-84 has significant scatter in creep testing. That can be seen in the
"conventional material results shown in Figure 6. In contrast, the SLM results fall almost perfectly on a straight line,",
"and where repeats have been done in the testing, excellent repeatability is observed. The cause of this improvement",
"must lie with the SLM process since the test rigs and the material remains otherwise constant. Regardless of the cause,",
S-basis minimum creep properties are improved due to the lack of variability.,
