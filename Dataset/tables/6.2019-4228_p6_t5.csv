,"Above 600 °C, wrought GRCop-42 and GRCop-84 have essentially the same strength. This is caused by the"
extremely weak pure Cu matrix dominating the strength of the alloys. The strength remains generally superior to,
"competitive alloys in this temperature range, and exposure of the GRCop alloys to these temperatures has minimal",
impact on the properties.,
