,GRCop-42 was also examined but not as extensively. GRCop-42 trades lower mechanical properties such as
strength for significantly higher thermal conductivity. GRCop-42 achieves 85% of the International Annealed Copper,
Standard (IACS) versus 75% IACS for GRCop-84 at room temperature. The alloy was of prime interest for reusable,
expander cycle rocket engines such as the proposed RL-60. While the database for GRCop-42 is less extensive than,
"the one for GRCop-84, sufficient information does exist for directly comparing the two alloys in the extruded form.",
