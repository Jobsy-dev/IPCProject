,Development of GRcop-42 using SLM
,"Based on the development work with extruded GRCop-42, it was determined it could meet several requirements"
"for future combustion chambers. These requirements included high thermal conductivity, excellent creep resistance,",
"long low-cycle fatigue life, and good strength at elevated temperatures. The prior work with AM GRCop-84 indicated",
that GRCop-42 was likely suited for development using additive manufacturing16. Using the SLM process on the,
"MSFC Concept laser M2, the development demonstrated near-fully-dense GRCop-42 components that may equal to",
or exceed their traditionally manufactured predecessors. The GRCop-42 SLM process development built upon the,
prior development work of the GRCop-84 SLM material development although processing parameters changed to,
match the different composition. The fundamental design and SLM work flow strategy remained the same through. A,
