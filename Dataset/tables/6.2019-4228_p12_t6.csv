,A separate study was determined inner and outer contouring parameters to reduced surface roughness for better
flow with a lower pressure drop in the cooling channels. An increase in surface roughness was observed as the laser,
"power and speed were increased (Figure 14). Based on the data obtained, the parameters for the specimen with the",
lowest roughness were utilized as the new baseline parameters yielding the smallest surface roughness of <350 μin.,
Printing order of the inner and outer contours was then modified to determine effect of printing sequence. These,
parameters transferred well between the Concept Laser M2 to the larger platform EOS M400,
