,"Analyzing the hotfire data from both test programs, the measured pressure differences were less than ±5% from"
"the nominal chamber pressure of 1,100 psig. The flow rate varied by less than ±2% from the nominal 6.8 lbm/sec.",
"Liner #2 did show a higher pressure drop compared to Liner #1, but it was only 10 to 25 psi. For all practical purposes,",
both chamber liners fall within the previously range and are considered similar. The consistent nature of the data is,
shown in Figure 25 and Figure 26.,
