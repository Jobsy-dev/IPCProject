,The OD groove allowed for small diameter wire to be traversed up and down each one of the channels to help
loosen and remove the powder. Several passes were made using this technique in addition to allowing the chamber,
(channels) to soak in alcohol for more than 12 hours and the use of alternating shop air within each of the channels.,
These techniques finally cleared a majority of the powder. A water flow test was conducted from the forward and aft,
end of the chamber revealing that each of the channels were flowing. A final CT scan was not conducted based on the,
visual evidence from the water flow test. A GN2 purge was maintained on the chamber to dry prior to HIP operations.,
,"It was suspected that some of the recycled powder, most of which is sieved, may have caused some clumps to form"
"due to the finer powder sizes. Other sources of contamination, such as moisture could have also been present - although",
"that was unlikely since the powder was trapped within the channels. These channel sizes were very similar and, in",
"most cross sections, larger than the LOX/Methane chambers described earlier in this paper.",
