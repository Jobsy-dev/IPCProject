,"If a designer does not have internal access to the SLM machines and process, it should be noted that one should"
be familiar with the post-processing of the part to allow for design features to be incorporated. Many SLM builds are,
"being contracted out, and in turn the full processing is being pushed onto the vendor. This includes model preparation,",
"SLM fabrication, powder removal, removal from build plate, support removal, surface preparation, local grinding,",
heat treatments and final machining. These pre-processing steps such as model preparation and post-processing steps,
"can have a significant impact on the final quality of the component being built, so one should be familiar or provide",
