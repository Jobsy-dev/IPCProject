,Three things were immediately apparent. The first observation was that there was significant anisotropy in the as-
built samples between the vertical or Z direction (parallel to the build direction) and the horizontal direction (in the,
"plane of the powder layers). The horizontal direction was almost 10% stronger, on average than the vertical direction.",
,The second observation was that the as-built samples were much stronger than the HIPed samples and had lower
ductility as measured by the tensile elongation. These indicate that large compressive residual stresses were present,
"in the as-built samples. After HIPing, the material, the strengths returned to values similar to those of extruded",
"GRCop-84, and the elongations increased. This was taken to indicate that there was a full anneal of the GRCop-84",
during HIPing.,
