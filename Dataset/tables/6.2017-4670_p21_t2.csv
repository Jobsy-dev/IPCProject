,Interchangeable Hybrid Additive Liner Slip Jacket Chamber Design
,Additional AM chamber development is being completed at MSFC using copper-alloy liners within a stainless
steel 304 slip jacket. This design uses a variant of the liners from the one-piece and two-piece chambers without the,
attachments of the manifold plenums. This simplified design used a series of rubber O-rings providing radial and face,
seals at the forward and aft ends. The jacket incorporated the O-ring grooves and a threaded aft capture ring was used,
to hold the liner in place within the jacket. This design allows for a quick change-out to test various geometries of,
channels or changes in materials. The TCA of the AM-liner with slip jacket and injector is shown in Figure 27.,
