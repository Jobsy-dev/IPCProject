,"Not shown in Figure 2 but documented elsewhere, HIPing and other high temperature thermal excursions will"
"decrease the strength of GRCop-84 relative to the baseline extruded material. In this case, the finer Cr Nb particles

resulted in additional strengthening and raised the strengths to be equivalent to that of the extruded material. This,
improvement indicates a potential benefit to using SLM and similar AM processes to consolidate GRCop alloys.,
