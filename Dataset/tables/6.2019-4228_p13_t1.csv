,One of the primary motivations for developing the GRCop-42 was the increased thermal conductivity compared
to GRCop-84 due to the increased Cu content. Initial development samples tested using the Laser Flash Method21,
demonstrated a 5-8% increase in conductivity over the temperature range tested as seen in Figure 15. The improved,
"conductivity allows for lowering the hot wall temperature to improve life, additional wall temperature margin or the",
ability to operate at slightly higher performance.,
