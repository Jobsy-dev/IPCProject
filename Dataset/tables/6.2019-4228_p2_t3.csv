,"Starting in 2014, the LCUSP program established the necessary AM build parameters, characterized AM",,
microstructures and mechanical,,properties,", and printed chambers using PBF. The chambers successfully completed"
a series of hot-fire tests9. GRCop-84 was baselined for LCUSP since at the program’s inception it was the most mature,,,
of the GRCop alloys with respect to available properties and processing techniques including joining. The GRCop-84,,,
SLM development under LCUSP was conducted at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) on the Concept,,,
"Laser M2 machine, materials characterization and testing at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), and Electron beam",,,
freeform fabrication at Langley Research Center (LaRC). The LCUSP program was successful in demonstrating the,,,
"entire GRCop-84 supply chain, fabrication using SLM, and successful hot-fire testing10. Since the LCUSP program’s",,,
"completion, several commercial PBF service vendors have established GRCop-84 printing capabilities for components",,,
and made them available for industry use. NASA has continued research in GRCop alloys to investigate further,,,
performance improvements.,,,
