,"GRCop-42 is a high conductivity, high-strength dispersion strengthened copper-alloy for use in high heat"
flux applications such as liquid rocket engine combustion devices. This alloy is part of the family of NASA-,
"developed GRCop, copper-chrome-niobium alloys. GRCop alloys were developed for harsh environments",
specific to regeneratively-cooled combustion chambers and nozzles with good oxidation resistance. Significant,
development was completed on the GRCop-84 and GRCop-42 alloys in the extruded wrought form,
demonstrating feasibility for combustion chambers. NASA has recently developed a process for additive,
"manufacturing, specifically Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) or Selective Laser Melting (SLM), of GRCop-42 to",
"establish parameters, characterize the material, and complete testing of components with complex internal",
features. This evolution of the GRCop-42 was based on the successful predecessor development work using,
"GRCop-84 with the motivation of establishing a new copper-alloy option for use in NASA, government, and",
industry programs with SLM. A few advantages have been shown with the GRCop-42 that include higher,
"conductivity and faster build speeds over the GRCop-84, and a simplified powder supply chain. Initial property",
development has shown that it is possible to produce high density builds with strengths equivalent to wrought,
GRCop-42 and a conductivity greater than GRCop-84. The GRCop-42 has completed process development,
and initial properties have been established. Several demonstrator combustion chambers have also been,
fabricated with the SLM GRCop-42 that include integral channels and closeouts. Additional test units have,
"been fabricated and are completing substantial hot-fire testing to demonstrate performance of the material,",
"process, and design.",
