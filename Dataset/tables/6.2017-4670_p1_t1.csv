,NASA and industry partners are working towards fabrication process development to reduce
costs and schedules associated with manufacturing liquid rocket engine components with the goal,
of reducing overall mission costs. One such technique being evaluated is powder-bed fusion or,
"selective laser melting (SLM), commonly referred to as additive manufacturing (AM). The NASA",
Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) program was designed to develop processes and,
"material characterization for GRCop-84 (a NASA Glenn Research Center-developed copper,",
"chrome, niobium alloy) commensurate with powder-bed AM, evaluate bimetallic deposition, and",
"complete testing of a full scale combustion chamber. As part of this development, the process has",
been transferred to industry partners to enable a long-term supply chain of monolithic copper,
combustion chambers. To advance the processes further and allow for optimization with multiple,
"materials, NASA is also investigating the feasibility of bimetallic AM chambers. In addition to the",
"LCUSP program, NASA has completed a series of development programs and hot-fire tests to",
"demonstrate SLM GRCop-84 and other AM techniques. NASA’s efforts include a 4K lb thrust
f",
liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/CH4) combustion chamber and subscale thrust chambers for 1.2K,
"lb LOX/hydrogen (H2) applications that have been designed and fabricated with SLM GRCop-
f",
"84. The same technologies for these lower thrust applications are being applied to 25-35K lb main
f",
"combustion chamber (MCC) designs. This paper describes the design, development,",
"manufacturing and testing of these numerous combustion chambers, and the associated lessons",
learned throughout their design and development processes.,
