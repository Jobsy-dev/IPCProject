,"Liquid methane is provided to the inlet manifold at the aft end. An open volume for this manifold is printed in,"
but the complete volume is created by welding on the closeout of the manifold. While the entire manifold structure,
"could have been printed, MSFC intentionally left the printed portion of the manifold open to allow for easier powder",
removal and channel inspections. The closeout portion of the manifold was machined from a traditional copper alloy.,
,"At the forward end, the open manifold allows the fuel to be directed into the fuel side of the mating injector. This"
open area of the printed structure also allowed for easy powder removal. A forward copper flange was welded on to,
create the bolt patterns required for the injector assembly and facility mounting.,
