,Several challenges exist in attempting to consolidate copper-based alloys using SLM. The first is that copper is
highly reflective in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum where many SLM machine lasers operate. The,
"second is that the alloys are highly conductive, so any heat put into the powder bed is rapidly conducted away from",
the melt pool. These two issues can limit the ability of an SLM laser to effectively melt copper-based alloys and form,
a fully dense part with no unmelted powder incorporated into it.,
