,"Starting in 2014, NASA’s LCUSP program has developed AM technologies and design tools aimed at reducing"
the costs and manufacturing time of regeneratively cooled rocket engine components LOX/hydrogen (H2) systems.,
LCUSP is a multi-center project with the project management and design leads at the Marshall Space Flight Center,
(MSFC). MSFC is also the lead in developing and optimizing the SLM manufacturing process for GRCop-84. Langley,
Research Center (LaRC) is the lead in developing and optimizing the Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3),
manufacturing process to direct deposit a nickel alloy structural jacket and manifold preparation regions onto an SLM,
manufactured GRCop-84 chamber. GRC is the lead in developing and characterizing materials properties and,
characterization for both the SLM manufactured GRCop-84 and the EBF3 Inconel and the joint between the two.,
