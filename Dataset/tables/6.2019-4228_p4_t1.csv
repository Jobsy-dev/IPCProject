increase about 10 W/mK at room temperature and raise the thermal conductivity to about 87% IACS. Even the higher,,
Fe GRCop-42 enjoys a significant advantage over GRCop-84 at all temperatures. It also is above 90% IACS at,,
temperatures exceeding 400 °C (752 °F). This conductivity is less than low-alloy copper alloys such as Cu-1 Cr and,,
"AMZIRC (Cu-0.1 Zr), but st","ill high enough to be very attractive, given the other good properti",es of the GRCop alloys3.
