,The design of the two-piece was nearly identical to that of the one-piece including variable channels and integral
"manifolds and inlet and outlet ports. However, the two-piece chamber incorporates two (2) EB welds at the forward",
end of the chamber to fully close out the manifold area for distribution of the coolant. This two-piece chamber,
simplifies the powder removal since each of the channels can be directly pressurized following AM of the initial,
chamber portion. The forward manifold closeout is printed in a second print with the flange attached to the build plate.,
There is minor post-processing of this part. The design and AM fabricated two-piece GRCop-84 chamber can be seen,
in Figure 26.,
