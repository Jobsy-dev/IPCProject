,"The GRCop-42 process parameter development yielded the initial density, mechanical, thermophysical, and"
surface finishes desired. The GRCop-42 process parameters also resulted in an improved processing time compared,
to the GRCop-84 resulting in approximately 20% reduction in build time. MSFC and GRC demonstrated that GRCop-,
42 is a readily printable alloy that can be additively manufactured into fully dense components with consistent,
"properties at higher throughput rates than its predecessor, GRCop-84.",
