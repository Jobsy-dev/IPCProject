"Diffusion coatings 
Overlay coatings (MCrAlY Types)",
Environmental resistance,
"Chromising:  
Forming Cr oxide surface. Corrosion 
resistance to sulphates at temperatures 
<1123K (high velocity gas streams).","Contain ~7wt% Al to form Al2O3. 
Increase Cr content to combat hot corrosion 
(sulphate contamination)."
"Aluminising:  
Formation of NiAl or CoAl in Ni-base & Co-
base superalloy respectively. Forming 
Al2O3 surface scales. Temperatures 
<1100°C; not too corrosive. Prone to 
thermal fatigue cracking.","Too high Cr or Si content (used to combat 
Type II hot corrosion) may affect diffusional 
stability of C:S interface at high 
temperatures. 
Cr oxide provides oxidation resistance up to 
~900°C. 
Al oxide provides oxidation resistance up to 
~1200°C. 
Al oxide-scales are not adherent when 
thermally cycled. add Y."
"Modified aluminides: 
 >1100°C. Improved thermal fatigue.","Presence of Cr to combat acid or basic fluxing 
mechanisms (Type I & Type II hot corrosion)."
Chemical compatibility (Interface stability / Adhesion),
"Interdiffusion across interface Al 
Substrate; Ni Coating, depending on 
alloy composition.","Interdiffusion effects between coating/ 
substrate lowers oxidation resistance of 
coating, notably Ti."
,"Diffusionally stable systems are: NiCrAlY on 
Ni-base or Fe-base substrates, CoCrAY on Fe-
base."
,"Unstable systems are: CoCrAlY on Ni-base, 
FeCrAlY on Ni-base or Fe-base."
Mechanical strength,
"Aluminide CTE < substrate at high temps 
Ductile  Brittle transition temperature > 
600°C typical.","Carbide interface forming for MCrAlY on Co-
base (less for CoCrAlY) (preferential oxidation 
path &/or spalling of coating)."
"Complex structure, difficult to determine 
intrinsic properties.",CTE difference should not exceed 2 x 10-4 /K.
,"DuctileBrittle transition temp increases 
with increasing Al content (100 to 600°C)."
,Some compositions exhibit superplasticity.
