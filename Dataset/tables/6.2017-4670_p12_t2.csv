,Structured Light Scanning was found to be a highly effective tool for characterization of the results of these
"additive processes. Scanning provided data relative to positional tolerance and feature sizes of SLM parts, data about",
movement of the materials as they were subjected to these additive processes and data that could be used to compare,
the as-modeled parts with the as-deposited state post deposition. Figure 15 shows an example of the scan data,
compared to the model data for an early manufacturing demonstrator unit. The green is the scan data and the black,
"line is the model. Several features become clear. First, the green line is inside of the black line on the top of the figure",
"below, showing how the part compressed toward the centerline. The top black line is the SLM GRCop-84 substrate",
"and did not have Inconel deposited in that region, so the movement represented movement of the substrate. Second,",
regions where the process limitations prevented deposition of the minimum required material are shown as regions,
where the green line is far outboard of the black line.,
