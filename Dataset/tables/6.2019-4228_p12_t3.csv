,"During initial development of the GRCop-42 material, powders from several vendors was evaluated using the"
baseline GRCop-42 process parameters on the MSFC Concept Laser M220. Parameters were developed to optimize,
both the infill to achieve desired mechanical and thermophysical properties. The contouring parameters were,
optimized to achieve desired surface finish (roughness). The core infill parameters yielded densities greater than 99.2%,
and favorable mechanical properties with high ultimate and elongation values. A minimum density of 99.2% was,
achieved with powder lots prior to a Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing) operation.,
