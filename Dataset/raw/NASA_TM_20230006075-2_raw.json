INTRODUCTION\nMetal additive manufacturing (AM) has been demonstrated to reduce the cost and lead\ntime associated with manufacturing of complex components with internal features and novel\nalloys. The AM processes are changing the design and manufacturing of liquid rocket engines\ncomponents such as injectors, combustion chambers, nozzles, valves, and other fluid and struc-\ntural systems. While additive manufacturing is continuing to evolve, it is still in its infancy, and\nover the past 10 years, the materials available have been limited.1 As AM is considered for a\ndesign application, the designer has been forced to use the limited available materials, which may\nnot be the optimal material for performance. The National Aeronautics and Space Administra-\ntion (NASA) has identified the need to develop and advance new materials for liquid rocket engine\n(LRE) applications such as hydrogen environments. One such material being developed is NASA\nHR-1.2–4 NASA HR-1 is a high-strength Fe-Ni superalloy designed to resist high pressure, hydro-\ngen environment embrittlement, oxidation, and corrosion.5\nCombustion device components on liquid rocket engines operate in extreme environments\nthat challenge the functional design, materials, and fabrication as part of an engine system. These\ncomponents include combustion chambers, nozzles, injectors, gas generators, and igniter systems.\nEach of these components serves different functions but have some commonality in requirements.\nThey must endure high pressure propellants, high temperature, and high pressure gases, while\nmaintaining positive structural margins but low mass as part of the engine system and launch\nvehicle. Component structures used in LREs can require very thin walls, in regeneratively-cooled\nnozzles for instance, that provide challenges for materials to sustain high thermal and structural\nloads. Additionally, combining the environment with liquid and gaseous hydrogen propellant to\nthe thermal and structural loads leads to an even more complex challenge. For these applications,\nmaterials must be designed to resist Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE).2–4 Further-\nmore, these components also have other key requirements to consider for materials selection,\nincluding mechanical strength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF), and thermophysical properties\nsuch as thermal conductivity.2–3\nThe regeneratively-cooled, or channel-cooled nozzle, is a key component in various engine\nsystems that expands combustion gases and increases the exhaust gas velocity. The cooled nozzle\nis often the largest structure on the liquid rocket engine but must maintain small internal channels\nfor proper cooling of the hot-wall to maintain adequate structural margins. The design is balanced\namong extreme temperature environments, high pressure fluids, and structural loads from pres-\n1",

A common heritage design for regenera-\ntively-cooled nozzles is the use of brazed tubes, but this technique presents challenges in the lead\ntime and number of piece-parts, tube-stacking and assembly operations, brazing, and tooling.6\nThe manufacturing of large channel wall nozzles have been explored using various technologies\nincluding hot isostatic pressing (HIP) assisted brazing, laser welding, plating, and laser wire direct\ncloseout.7,8 NASA and other organizations have discussed the use of AM and advanced manu-\nfacturing techniques to solve some of the traditional manufacturing challenges for combustion\nchambers and nozzles.9–13 Many of these techniques focus on the reduction in cost and schedule\nfor fabrication but have also put an emphasis on increasing the scale, specifically AM processes.\nThe laser powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) process uses concentrated thermal\nenergy, achieved with a laser, to fuse metals by melting locally as the material is injected into a\nmeltpool.3 This process allows for freeform fabrication of components or addition of material to\ncomponents for the purposes of coating, repair, or modification using local deposition. Freeform\ncomponents are formed by the precise control of toolpath parameters created from a CAD model\nthat creates individual (weld) beads that are deposited to take a final geometric shape. LP-DED\nuses powder feedstock as the filler material and a laser as the energy source. The powder and laser\noptics are mounted on an integrated deposition head, which allows for the convergence of the laser\nand powder at a defined focus at the surface of the substrate where material is melted and cooled\nto form the bead. The build substrate can be a sacrificial build plate or an existing component.\nThe deposition head is mounted to a robotic arm or gantry system to control the motion through\nprogrammed or logic tool paths to deposit material or create features. An example of the process\ncan be seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Material being deposited using LP-DED.3 Images used with permissions from:\n(Left) Addup, and (Right) Formalloy.\n2",

      "text": "The LP-DED processed NASA HR-1 requires several post-processing heat treatment steps\nto attain the material’s properties that are desirable for the application. These steps often include\na stress relief, homogenization, solution anneal, and aging treatment for precipitation hardened\nalloys.2–4 An effective stress relief mitigates residual stresses built up in the part during the LP-\nDED process and minimizes the potential distortions. The second step, homogenization, is a\ncommon treatment for AM materials to reduce elemental segregation and promote recrystalliza-\ntion to achieve a more equiaxed grain structure in the material. The third step, solution treatment,\nbrings the part to a solid solution temperature to dissolve undesirable η-phase that forms during\ncooling from homogenization treatment, and then is rapidly cooled to maintain η-phase free solid\nsolution. Finally, the aging treatment promotes the precipitation of the strengthening phase in the\nalloy, the γ′ phase for NASA HR-1.2,5\nThere are five key requirements to consider for LRE nozzle material selection, including\nmechanical strength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF), and thermal conductivity.3 These five\nmaterial properties are all interrelated and must be taken into consideration when optimizing the\nalloy composition and heat treatment for the LP-DED NASA HR-1 alloy. This Technical Memo-\nrandum addresses the development of LP-DED NASA HR-1 through optimization of chemical\ncomposition and heat treatment to obtain an optimum balance of key material properties for\nliquid rocket engine applications. To date, the composition of NASA HR-1 has been successfully\nmodified for use with the LP-DED technique. The PHACOMP method was applied to guide com-\nposition modification in order to obtain an optimum balance of the five key material properties.3\nImproved homogenization and 2-step aging treatments were also developed to reduce Ti segrega-\ntion to an acceptable level that is essential for mitigation of η-phase precipitation at grain bound-\naries. There were many observations and lessons learned from the development of LP-DED NASA\nHR-1. The combined effects of composition modification and heat treatment optimization enable\nhigh quality NASA HR-1 components to be fabricated via the LP-DED technique. The improved\nchemical and microstructural homogeneities make LP-DED NASA HR-1 components more duc-\ntile and have higher resistance to LCF in high pressure hydrogen environment, which is vital for\nthe success and safety of LRE nozzles.\n3",

The as-built samples received stress-relief\ntreatment at 1950 °F/1.5h with a slow furnace cool. After stress relief, the samples were subjected\nto a homogenization treatment at 2125 °F/6h in a vacuum furnace. At the end of homogenization\ntreatment, the samples were Ar quenched to minimize η-phase precipitation. Then, the samples\nwere solution annealed at 1950 °F/1h in vacuum with an Ar quench and followed by aging at\n1325 °F/16h or 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h in vacuum to complete the heat treatment process.\n2.4 Metallography and SEM analysis\nSelected LP-DED NASA HR-1 specimens were metallurgically characterized after heat\ntreatment and mechanical testing. Specimens were sectioned, mounted, ground, and polished\nusing standard metallographic procedures with a series of 220-2,000 grit paper and 3 µm diamond\nsuspension – 0.05 µm alumina pads. Chemical etching was conducted with waterless Kaling’s\nreagent immersed for 5–10 seconds. Microstructures of as-deposited and heat treated NASA HR-1\nwere examined via optical (Leica DMi8 A) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi\nS-3700N) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Oxford Instru-\nments X-maxN 80). High resolution optical montage images were taken to document the micro-\nstructure for the entire sample. Elemental analysis was conducted using EDS line scans at 15 kV\nand 0.5 µm between spectra.\nInvestigation of titanium segregation was carried out using an EDS detector attached to an\nSEM. For as-deposited samples, EDS line scans were performed across the solidification structure\nthat has a minimum distance of 250 µm to reveal the concentration profile of titanium. For heat\ntreated samples, the EDS line scans were greater than 250 µm and across at least one grain (two\ngrain boundaries) to see the fluctuation of titanium concentration between grain boundaries and\ngrain interior. Homogenization kinetic calculations were performed to determine the titanium\nconcentration distribution between grain boundaries as a function of homogenization tempera-\nture, time and grain size.\n2.5 Mechanical Testing\nInitial tensile testing was performed in ambient air with a strain rate of 0.5 in/in/min at\nthree different temperatures, –320 °F, room temperature, and 1200 °F.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1 Melting and solidification characteristics\nDTA (Differential Thermal Analysis) can precisely determine solids/liquids temperatures\nand detect precipitate formation/dissolution reactions for an alloy in a timely fashion without\nlaborious heat treating and metallographic analysis. In addition, DTA can compare alloy solidifi-\ncation temperature range (STR) and volume fraction of terminal eutectic phase that can provide\ninsights into weldability and printability in additive manufacturing. During the early stage of\nLP-DED NASA HR-1 development, little data was available to help understand the solid-liquid\ntransition temperatures during AM heating and cooling processes. Therefore, DTA was used to\nanalyze the melting and solidification behaviors for NASA HR-1. The nominal powder composi-\ntion of NASA HR-1 and JBK-75 is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2. Nominal powder composition of NASA HR-1 and JBK-75.\nAlloy Powder Fe Ni Cr Mo V W Co Ti Al\nNASA HR–1 39.80 34.00 15.50 2.20 0.32 2.10 3.30 2.50 0.25\nJBK–75 51.13 30.20 14.75 1.25 0.30 – – 2.10 0.25\nFigure 6 shows the typical DTA heating and cooling curves for NASA HR-1 powder. On\nheating, there are two distinct endothermic peaks. The first peak represents the melting tempera-\nture (on-heating liquidus at 2516 °F) of γ matrix, whereas the second peak is close to the melting\ntemperature of pure iron (Fe) at 2737 °F. The presence of two endothermic melting peaks indicates\nthat there was appreciable elemental segregation in the powder particles. During the cooling cycle,\nthere is a distinct solidification peak at 2455 °F (on-cooling solidus) and a smaller exothermic peak\nthat represents terminal liquid solidification at 2320 °F. The solidification temperature range for\nNASA HR-1 powder is determined to be 196 °F, which is taken as the difference between the on-\nheating liquidus temperature (2516 °F) and the on-cooling terminal liquid solidification tempera-\nture (2320 °F).\n10",

Overall, these two alloys exhibit similar melting\nand solidification behavior. One notable difference between these two alloys is the solidification\ntemperature range (STR), which is 151 °F for LP-DED NASA HR-1 and 196 °F for LP-DED JBK-\n75. Figure 9 compares the terminal liquid solidification peaks for LP-DED NASA HR-1 and LP-\nDED JBK-75. These two materials exhibit a eutectic-terminal liquid solidification peak that occurs\nat 2358 – 2370 °F. It is evident that LP-DED NASA HR-1 has a more distinct terminal liquid solidi-\nfication peak at around 2370 °F. LP-DED JBK-75 also has a terminal liquid solidification peak at\naround 2358 °F, but it is very small suggesting the terminal liquid vol.-% is much smaller than that\nin LP-DED NASA HR-1. Susceptibility to weld solidification cracking is affected by both metal-\nlurgical factors and the level of local strain at the end of solidification. In terms of metallurgical\nfactors, the STR as well as the amount and distribution of the terminal liquid are the primary\nfactors that affect the susceptibility of solidification cracking in Ni-base alloys. The solidification\ntemperature range controls the size of semi-solid crack susceptible region that surrounds the liquid\nweld pool. A narrow STR is preferred as a relatively wider STR will produce a larger semi-solid\ncrack susceptible region, thus increasing the weld cracking susceptibility.13\n13\n)gm/Vu(/TΔ",

LP-DED NASA HR-1 has a more distinct terminal liquid solidifica-\ntion peak at around 2370° F.\nIn many alloys, cracks can form during the terminal stages of solidification when liquid\nfilms are distributed along the grain boundaries and, in some cases, interdendritic sites. At this\nstage, shrinkage strains across the partially solidified boundaries can become appreciable. For\na given alloy system, the solidification temperature range and amount of terminal liquid are\ncontrolled primarily by chemical composition. The amount of terminal liquid is the product of a\neutectic reaction that occurs at the end of solidification. This eutectic reaction occurs at a lower\ntemperature than the alloy solidus and expands the solidification temperature range, making the\nalloy more susceptible to solidification cracking. However, when the amount of terminal liquid\nis high, it can often flow back into the cracks and provide a ‘crack healing’ effect. It is generally\nrecognized that the backfilling of solidification cracks by the terminal eutectic liquid can reduce\n14\n)gm/Vu(/TΔ )gm/Vu(/TΔ",

Metal additive manufacturing (such\nas LP-DED and L-PBF) is fundamentally a repeated welding process, where the layer-by-layer\ngrowth of the component is achieved through local melting of metal powder by a laser energy\nsource. Although the metallic AM process results in solidification cooling rates that are far higher\nthan those seen in more traditional welding processes, the existing weldability and weld crack-\ning susceptibility theories can still be applied for AM materials. Candidate materials for AM\nshould be weldable alloys that are less susceptible to cracking that originates in the liquid phase,\nsuch as solidification cracking and liquation cracking. AM alloys should also have good resis-\ntance to solid-state cracking phenomenon that occurs due to stresses build-up at temperatures\nslightly below the solidus temperature, such as strain-age cracking and ductility-dip cracking.\nNASA HR-1 in wrought form has excellent resistance to solidification cracking.5 Based on its Al,\nTi, Cr, and Co contents, NASA HR-1 is expected to have good resistance to strain-age cracking\nand ductility dip cracking.15 Therefore, it is postulated the excellent printability that NASA HR-1\npossesses when building components using LP-DED and L-PBF processes can be attributed to its\ndecent resistance to liquid and solid state cracking.\n3.2 Microstructure Evolution\n3.2.1 Microstructure of As-Built LP-DED NASA HR-1\nFigure 10 shows the typical cross section microstructure of an as-built 3.175 mm thick LP-\nDED panel. This panel was deposited at a laser power of 1070 watts with a single pass per layer\nthat are parallel to the previous layer. The melt pool boundary is readily apparent in the as built\nmaterial. The columnar dendrites, which are common in as-built LP-DED materials, are shown in\ngreater detail in Figure 10(b). In the high energy LP-DED process, the melt pools are cooled rap-\nidly and the growing grains (and dendrites) align themselves with the temperature gradients and\nresult in columnar structure morphology.16 The dendrites exhibit a pattern of formation from the\nouter perimeter of the melt pool toward a central point in single-pass LP-DED NASA HR-1. The\nlarge temperature gradient provides favorable conditions for epitaxial dendrite (grain) growth. As\na result, the dendrites in the new layers are formed with the same orientation as the previous lay-\ners through several melt pools. The dendrites are somewhat randomly oriented near the melt pool\nperiphery (toward the panel outer surface) likely due to the complex temperature gradient from the\nmelt pool to the surrounding material. A close-up view of the dendritic structure in an as-built\nsingle-pass LP-DED NASA HR-1 panel is shown in Figure 11. The size of dendrite cell is very\nsmall and the dendritic arm spacing is in most cases smaller than 25 µm. Solute rejection of tita-\nnium to the interdendritic regions on solidification leads to the preferential attack upon etching.\nAs a result, the existence of titanium segregation is revealed as the dark spots in the interdendritic\nregions.3\n15",

These panels were deposited at a laser power of 1070 watts\nwith a single pass per layer that are parallel to the previous layer. The sample that received stress\nrelief treatment at 1700 °F exhibits dominant dendritic structure similar to that of the as-built\nmaterial. The dendritic morphologies were significantly weakened with increasing the stress relief\ntemperature. Significant microstructure changes occurred when the stress relief temperature rose\nto 1800 °F. The dendritic structure has almost vanished, and the early stage of recrystallization\nhas occurred after being heat treated at 1800 °F/1.5h. Stress relief at 1900 °F/1.5h led to a slightly\nhigher degree of recrystallization but the grain structure remains very heterogeneous (see Figure\n12(d)). During the LP-DED process, the rapid heating and cooling of the melt pools along with the\nmolten metal volume change upon solidification result in buildup of residual stress in the parts.\nThe driving force for recrystallization is the residual stress from the additive manufacturing pro-\ncess.17–19 It is apparent that the residual stress for single-pass LP-DED NASA HR-1 is quite high\nthat partial recrystallization occurs when the stress relief temperature is higher than 1800 °F.\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 12.

It is obvious that a high degree of recrystallization and grain growth had\ntaken place after the homogenization treatment as shown in Figure 13. The grain size is quite large\nand many grains in the material are larger than 250 µm in diameter. The large grain structure can\nbe attributed to the large melt pool dimensions in these single-pass LP-DED panels. It is worth\nnoting that the homogenized sample displays smaller grains near the surface and larger grains\ntoward the center regions. The uneven grain size distribution is caused by faster melt pool cool-\ning rate at the part periphery than in the part center during the LP-DED process. Precipitation of\nthe undesirable brittle η-phase (Ni Ti) is very sensitive to the cooling rates after homogenization\n3\ntreatment. Upon the completion of the homogenization treatment, the samples were cooled rap-\nidly through Ar quench method to mitigate precipitation of η-phase (Fig. 13). The as-homogenized\nsample appears free of η-phase.\nFigure 13. Macrostructure of a 3.175 mm thick single-pass LP-DED NASA HR-1 panel after\nhomogenization at 2175 °F/3h.

The matrix phase,\n3\nγ, is a solid solution of Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mo, and W, whereas the precipitate phase γ′ is associated\nwith the hardening elements, Ti and Al. In addition, η phase has been observed in the microstruc-\nture. η phase is a Ti rich acicular precipitate that generally forms at grain boundaries but does\nform within the grains with prolonged exposure at elevated temperatures. After homogeniza-\ntion treatment, the samples were solution annealed at 1800 °F/1h, followed by argon quenching.\nThese samples were then aged at 1325 °F/16h to complete the heat treatment process for LP-DED\nNASA HR-1. As shown in Figure 14(a), the microstructure appears η-phase free after solution\nanneal. The parts were cooled rapidly from 1800 °F to ambient temperature by quenching in water\nto maintain η-phase free solid solution. However, precipitation of η-phase at grain boundaries\noccurred after the standard aging treatment at 1325°F/16h as shown in Figure 14(b). It is postu-\nlated that dissolution of η phase had taken place at 1800 °F but Ti concentration at grain bound-\naries remained quite high.

For Fe-Ni-based superalloys, the prevalent\nnucleation sites for η-phase during aging treatment are the grain boundaries because η-phase has\na hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure that is non-coherent with the matrix.20 The presence\nof grain-boundary η phase (Ni Ti) in fully heat-treated LP-DED NASA HR-1 samples is a seri-\n3\nous concern as η-phase is brittle and has a negative impact on tensile ductility, LCF life, and HEE\nresistance.\nFor LP-DED NASA HR-1, precipitation of undesirable grain-boundary η-phase can be\nmitigated by optimization of (1) chemical composition and (2) heat treatment. In general, the for-\nmation of ·η-phase is strongly related to (1) Ti/Al ratio, (2) Ti content, and (3) alloy composition.21\nWhen Ti/Al ratio is high, the Ti-rich γ′ can transform to the η-phase during aging. Moreover, the\nvolume fraction of η-phase generally increases with a greater Ti/Al ratio. In contrast, in an alloy\nwith higher Ti content, the η-phase can easily form with a lower Ti/Al ratio. This indicates that\nboth Ti/Al ratio and Ti content must be tailored to mitigate the formation of η-phase. Further-\nmore, mitigation of η-phase precipitation can be accomplished through heat treatment modifica-\ntion to reduce Ti segregation and retard γ′ to η-phase transformation.4 In addition to mitigating\nη precipitation to improve HEE resistance, the chemistry and heat treatment optimization efforts\nwere also directed toward obtaining an optimal balance of the primary material properties (such\nas tensile strength, low cycle fatigue, and ductility) for LRE applications.\n3.3 Obtaining an Optimal Balance of Five Important Material Properties\nLiquid rocket engines operate in extreme and challenging environments in which the\ntemperature can range from that of liquid hydrogen (–423 °F) to 6000 °F hot gas.22 Component\nstructures used in LREs require very thin walls in regeneratively-cooled nozzles that place great\ndemands on materials selection as the structures must be able to endure enormous thermal shock\nduring transients and large temperature differentials across walls during engine operation. Addi-\ntionally, combining the environment with liquid and gaseous hydrogen propellant to the thermal\nand structural loads provides an even more complex challenge. For these applications, materials\nmust be designed to resist Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE). In addition, there are\nalso other key requirements to consider for LRE structural material selection, including tensile\nstrength, ductility, low cycle fatigue (LCF) resistance, and thermal conductivity.3 The importance\nof the key properties is shown below:\n(1) Mechanical Strength – During the operation of LRE, the nozzle or chamber wall is\nsubjected to high thermal load induced by huge temperature difference across the wall and the\nmechanical load caused by the pressure difference between the coolant-side wall and the hot-gas-\nside wall.23–25 Yielding is expected as localized stress would be beyond the elastic limit and inelas-\ntic strain will accumulate in the plastically deformed regions. High strength is required so that the\n21",

After many work cycles, the residual strain can accumulate to an extent that\ncracks begin to initiate in the cooling channels (typically in the hotwall, which has the highest\nstrains). Hence, LCF is the primary service life limiting factor of regenerative cooling channel wall\nnozzles.25\n(4) Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE) – Due to the use of high-pressure liquid\nhydrogen as propellant for some LREs, the selected LRE nozzle materials must resist Hydrogen\nEnvironment Embrittlement (HEE). The high-pressure liquid hydrogen coolant that enters the\ncooling channels absorbs heat and maintains wall temperatures low enough to prevent melting.\nThe liquid hydrogen coolant warms up and gasifies, creating high pressure gaseous hydrogen envi-\nronment in the cooling channels. HEE effects will become more pronounced when the channel\ninner hotwall temperature is between –100 °C to 100 °C.26 Therefore, having excellent resistance to\nHEE is one of the most important material selection criteria for LRE nozzle materials that oper-\nate in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment.\n(5) Thermal Conductivity – The nozzle wall is subjected to high heat flux from the combus-\ntion gases. To protect the nozzle wall, regenerative cooling must be applied by flowing a cryogenic\nliquid (or sometimes gaseous) propellant into the nozzle cooling channels to prevent the nozzle\nfrom melting. Therefore, nozzle materials must have high thermal conductivity to improve the\ncooling efficiency of cryogenic propellant and lower the nozzle temperature and thermal strain.23\nThese five key properties are all interrelated and must be taken into consideration when\noptimizing the formulation and heat treatment for LP-DED NASA HR-1. High strength materi-\nals tend to have issues with ductility, low cycle fatigue, and fracture toughness. After conducting\na thorough assessment, it was determined that the most appropriate way to obtain an optimal\ncompromise of the five important material properties is through a moderate strength reduction as\nshown in Figure 17. A moderate 10 – 15% strength reduction is expected to increase ductility, LCF\nlife, and maintain good HEE resistance and thermal conductivity. To date, an optimal comprise\nof these five important material properties has been accomplished through optimization of alloy\nchemistry and heat treatment.\n22",

The original formulation and heat treatment for LP-DED\nNASA HR-1 has been optimized to obtain an optimal comprise of these five materials\nproperties.\n3.3.1 Alloy Chemistry Optimization\nThe development of many historical superalloys was accomplished primarily by tedious\ntrial-and-error approach.27 Phase prediction using simple binary or ternary phase diagrams was\nnot a viable option due to the complex nature of the highly alloyed superalloys and lack of com-\nputational tools at the time. A modern analytical tool that can be used to predict microstruc-\nture stability and formation of deleterious phases in superalloys is PHACOMP, which stands for\nPHAse COMPutation. PHACOMP was developed by Morinaga et al. to predict austenite phase\n(γ) stability vs TCP or GCP phase formation in Ni-base, Co-base and Fe-base alloys.28–33 The\nPHACOMP concept was devised based on molecular orbital calculation (the discrete variational\n(DX)-Xα cluster method) for transition-metal-based alloys. TCP stands for topologically-closed-\npack intermetallic phases (e.g. σ, χ, and Laves phases), and GCP stands for geometrically closed-\npack intermetallic phases (e.g. η, δ phases).34 PHACOMP was successfully applied to control the\nformation of GCP phases, such as η phase, for the development of high-entropy alloys.35 In brief,\nthe PHACOMP method offers new approaches to advance the alloy design by estimating the solid\nsolubility in superalloys to control the formation of undesirable TCP/GCP phases. PHACOMP\nuses a parameter, Md, which is an average d-electron energy above the Fermi energy level of\nalloying transition metals, to estimate the solid solubility of FCC (Face Centered Cubic) γ matrix.\nOverall, the alloy chemistry optimization for LP-DED NASA HR-1 follows the following criteria:\n• Md level was kept close to that of JBK-75 to increase stability of the γ (austenitic) matrix that is\nessential to mitigate η-phase formation.\n• Ni and Fe form the matrix of FCC γ phase, which acts as base or solvent for other elements in\nthe alloy. A slight increase in Fe helps to depress Md. The Fe:Ni ratio was increased slightly to\nmaintain high resistance to HEE.36\n23",

Co offers solid solution strengthening and can also\nincrease the solid solubility for the γ′ forming elements (Ti, Al) and retard η-phase formation.\n• Cr was reduced slightly to reduce Md. Cr is mainly present in γ matrix and is a potent solid-\nsolution strengthener. Cr promotes formation of the protective Cr O oxide layer that gives the\n2 3\nalloy its hot corrosion resistance.\n• W is an important refractory element that provides persistent solid-solution strengthening at\nelevated temperatures. W was reduced slightly to bring Md to a lower level. In NASA HR-1, a\nminimum of 1 wt% of W is required to provide adequate resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.\nAddition of W drastically reduces the stacking fault energy (SFE) of superalloys, which has\nbeen shown to decrease the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement for several binary transi-\ntion metal alloys.37\n• Mo was reduced slightly to bring Md to a lower level. Similar to W, Mo is also a refractory\nelement that provides persistent solid-solution strengthening at elevated temperatures. A slight\nreduction in both Mo and W contents would reduce strength and improve ductility and LCF\nresistance.\n• Ti and Al serve as the basis for the strengthening mechanism in Fe-Ni-base Superalloys as\nthey combine with Ni to form the strengthening γ′ precipitate (Ni (Ti,Al)). Ti content and Ti/\n3\nAl ratio were slightly reduced to mitigate η-phase formation and to obtain an optimal compro-\nmise of the five material properties through a moderate strength reduction.\nIn PHACOMP analysis, Md, which is an average d-electron energy above the Fermi energy\nlevel is calculated from the alloy composition. The Md values for various commonly used transi-\ntion alloying elements in fcc Ni are listed in Table 4.

For simplicity, the unit\nof Md parameter, eV, is omitted in this paper. When Md increases beyond a critical value, the\nMd method assumes that the phase instability will occur and a secondary phase will appear in a\nterminal solid solution. In other words, the critical Md determines the solubility limit of γ matrix.\nThis Md Equation can be expressed empirically based on the atomic concentration of the alloy-\ning elements in the overall alloy composition. For example, the Md value for the final formulation\n(previously named Revision 3) LP-DED NASA HR-1 is calculated as follows:\nMd = (Md) × X (Fe atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Ni atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Cr\nFe Fe Ni Ni Cr Cr\natomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Mo atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (V atomic fraction) +\nMo Mo V V\n(Md) × X (W atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Co atomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Ti\nW W Co Co Ti Ti\natomic fraction) + (Md) × X (Al atomic fraction)\nAl Al\n= 0.858 × 0.4204 (Fe at%) + 0.717 × 0.3300 (Ni at%) + 1.142 × 0.1600 (Cr at%) + 1.55 × 0.0107\n(Mo at%) + 1.543 × 0.0034 (V at%) + 1.655 × 0.0050 (W at%) + 0.777 × 0.0367 (Co at%) +\n2.271 × 0.0268 (Ti at%) + 1.900 × 0.0053 (Al at%) = 0.9134\nSimilar calculations were performed for other alloys to yield the Md values. PHACOMP\ncan determine a critical Md value, above which microstructure instability occurs. Currently,\nthe critical Md value that must be kept below to avoid η-phase formation for NASA HR-1 is not\nknown. Since η-phase in A-286 and JBK-75 can be kept to a very low level after heat treatment,\nthe Md levels of A-286 and JBK-75 were used as the estimated critical threshold value for LP-DED\nNASA HR-1. Therefore, the Md values for LP-DED NASA HR-1 was kept very close to that of\nA-286 and JBK-75 to improve the γ matrix stability. Another important consideration for the LP-\nDED NASA HR-1 composition modification is its excellent HEE resistance should not be altered.\nBased on the above approaches, the chemical composition for LP-DED NASA HR-1 has\nbeen optimized as shown in Table 5. The initial and final formulation of LP-DED NASA HR-1\nwas previously named “revision 2” and “revision 3”, respectively for internal use. Due to the\nreduction in Md value, LP-DED NASA HR-1 final formulation is expected to have better micro-\nstructure stability than the initial formulation. Figure 18 compares the Md values for the alloys\nlisted in Table 5. LP-DED NASA HR-1 final formulation (revision 3) is the composition that has\nbeen optimized to obtain an optimal balance of primary material properties for LRE nozzles. The\nreduction of Ti content and the overall M value is expected to retard precipitation of undesirable\nd\ngrain boundary η-phase and achieve an optimal balance of the primary material properties for\nLRE applications.\n25",

Thus, the AM material often has heterogeneous microstructures, and non-uniform\nchemical composition and phase distribution.2–3 These characteristics make it difficult to produce\nAM parts with materials properties and microstructures that are as reproducible as same alloys\nproduced by conventional wrought process. Once the composition of wrought NASA HR-1 was\nmodified for the LP-DED alloy using the PHACOMP method, attention was directed toward heat\ntreatment optimization.\nThe as-deposited LP-DED NASA HR-1 has a high degree of titanium segregation in\nthe interdendritic regions. Titanium segregation promotes precipitation of η-phase (Ni Ti) at\n3\ngrain boundaries that is detrimental to tensile ductility, LCF life, and resistance to hydrogen\nenvironment embrittlement. Therefore, a new heat treatment was developed to minimize titanium\nsegregation and η-phase precipitation for LP-DED NASA HR-1. A heat treatment investigation\nplan was put together based on the homogenization kinetic analysis as shown in Table 6. A\nhigher temperature stress relief at 1950 °F was attempted to understand the effects of stress relief\ntemperature on grain structure evolution. Homogenization treatment was extended for times up to\n12 hours at 2125 °F. It is a great concern that the standard solution anneal temperature of 1800 °F\nwas too close to the upper boundary of the η-phase TTP diagram.39 Therefore, higher solution\nanneal temperature was also attempted at 1950 °F to ensure η-phase is completely dissolved\nand Ti concentration at grain boundary is reduced to a very low level prior to the final aging\ntreatment.\nTable 6.

It is desirable\nto have finer and more equiaxed grain structure. Stress relief causes recovery and some degree of\nrecrystallization. Variation in grain structure evolution after stress relief results from the com-\npetition between the recovery process and the concurrent recrystallization. The driving force for\nrecrystallization is the thermal residual stresses that are introduced from the LP-DED process.\nLower temperature stress relief extended the recovery process and reduced the driving force for\nrecrystallization. Higher stress relief temperature promotes recrystallization and suppresses the\nrecovery process. When the stress relief temperature is increased to 1900 °F and above, recovery\nprocess is largely suppressed, and the number of active recrystallization nuclei increases, leading\nto smaller and more equiaxed grain structure after homogenization treatment at 2125 °F. Finer,\nmore equiaxed and more evenly distributed grain structure can improve overall mechanical prop-\nerties, reducing the anisotropy in mechanical properties. Therefore, selecting an optimal combi-\nnation of stress relief and homogenization treatments to minimize recovery process and promote\nrecrystallization is a significant method to consider for LP-DED NASA HR-1.\nEvolution of titanium segregation evolution in LP-DED NASA HR-1 after LP-DED deposi-\ntion and post-processing homogenization has been investigated in detail.4 It was found that tita-\nnium segregation migrates from the interdendritic regions (in as-built LP-DED material) to grain\nboundaries after homogenization treatment. A basic model for titanium diffusion in NASA HR-1\nwas developed to project concentration distribution of titanium as a function of homogenization\ntemperature, duration, and grain size. The results of the homogenization kinetic analysis provide\na valuable reference on how the homogenization treatment should be adjusted for LP-DED NASA\nHR-1.

      "text": "High Ti segregation at grain boundaries is not normally seen in wrought NASA HR1\n[5]. The difference in grain-boundary Ti segregation between LP-DED NASA HR-1 and the\nwrought alloy can be attributed to the difference in the solidification rates between LP-DED\nand casting processes. Comparing to the LP-DED process, the casting process has much slower\ncooling (solidification) rate that allows for prolonged cooling time, permitting the slow-to-diffuse\nelements (such as Ti) to disperse more homogeneously. NASA HR-1 castings usually receive\nhomogenization treatment at elevated temperatures for 24 hours, which is significantly longer than\nthe recommended 2125 °F/6h for LP-DED NASA HR-1. Additionally, the chemical inhomogeneity\nin wrought NASA HR-1 can be further reduced to a very low level by thermo-mechanical\nprocesses such as hot rolling and forging. Thus, extended homogenization treatment coupled with\nthermo-mechanical process drastically reduced Ti segregation and the propensity to form the\ndetrimental η-phase at grain boundary in LP-DED NASA HR-1.\n3.3.2.3 Mitigation of η-phase Precipitation through Solution Anneal and Aging. After\nhomogenization, solution anneal and aging processes are performed sequentially to precipitate\nand grow the strengthening γ′ precipitate (Ni (Ti,Al)). NASA HR-1 is a precipitate hardened\n3\nmaterial and solution anneal should be performed above the η-phase solvus temperature to\ndissolve the undesirable η-phase that forms during cooling from homogenization treatment. The\nstandard solution anneal for LP-DED NASA HR-1 is 1800 °F/1h, which is only approximately\n50 °F above the η-phase solvus temperature.39 Therefore, solution anneal temperature was\nincreased to 1950 °F to ensure complete dissolution of η-phase, followed by a quench. Another\nadvantage of conducting SA at 1950 °F is that Ti segregation amplitude can be slightly reduced\naccording to the homogenization kinetic analysis.4\nThe standard aging treatment for wrought NASA HR-1 is 1325 °F/16h. It was discovered\nthat the standard single-step aging treatment at 1325 °F/16h was unable to reduce the precipitation\nof brittle η-phase (Ni Ti) to an acceptable level for LP-DED NASA HR-1, primarily due to high\n3\nmagnitude of localized Ti segregation. Figure 23 shows precipitation of η-phase at grain boundar-\nies when aging treatment was performed at 1325 °F, 1300 °F, and 1275 °F. Grain boundaries are\nη-phase free after solution anneal at 1800 °F/1h as shown in Figure 23 (a). Abundant η-phase pre-\ncipitated at grain boundaries after aging at 1325 °F/24h. The volume fraction of grain-boundary\nη-phase decreases significantly when the aging temperature was lowered to 1300 °F (Fig. 23 (c)).\nOnly a few isolated η-phase was present at grain boundaries after aging at 1275 °F/16h (Fig. 23\n(d)). It is apparent that the amount of grain-boundary η-phase decreases with a reduction in aging\ntemperature. Therefore, 1275 °F was selected as the 1st step aging temperature.\n34",

In order to keep the strength\nreduction within a moderate 10 – 15% range, the standard single-step aging treatment must be\nmodified into a 2-step aging process. Two-step aging treatment is commonly used for age-harden-\nable superalloys to maximize strength and to develop the best combination of short-term tensile\nand long-term creep properties.41 In γ′-strengthened superalloys, the 1st aging treatment (higher\ntemperature) precipitates secondary γ′ precipitates and finer secondary or tertiary γ′ precipitates\nduring the 2nd step aging (lower temperature).42,43 The most important mechanism of η-phase pre-\ncipitation during aging treatment is γ′→ η transformation.

Four\naging treatments were selected for tensile property evaluation as shown in Table 7. The standard\naging treatment for wrought NASA HR-1, 1325 °F/16h, was included as the baseline for compari-\nson with the other three aging treatments. All tests were performed in air at room temperature\nwith the as-deposited wall thickness and diameter shown in Table 7. The most promising 2-step\naging treatment was chosen after performing an in-depth analysis on tensile data, which includes\nyield strength, ultimate tensile strength, ductility, and strain hardening exponent n (σ = Kεn). The\nstrain hardening exponent can be determined by using the true stress-true strain curve obtained\nfrom a tensile test. The Equation below describes the true stress-true strain correlation during the\ntensile testing:\nο ε (4)\nWhere σ is true stress, K is the strength coefficient, ε is true strain, and n is strain hardening expo-\nnent. A simple power-curve relation can express the flow curve of many metals in the region of\nuniform plastic deformation, which is from yielding up to the maximum load. The strain-harden-\ning exponent is the slope of the true stress-true strain curve, when plotted on logarithmic coordi-\nnates (n = ∂lnσ/∂lnε). A high strain hardening exponent enhances a materials ability to uniformly\ndistribute the imposed plastic strain.\nTable 7 summarizes the effects of aging treatment on room temperature tensile properties\nfor LP-DED NASA HR-1. The 1070W – 0.6” diameter round bar samples have an average yield\nstrength, ultimate tensile strength, and fracture elongation of 87.02 – 109.60 ksi, 162.40 – 171.61 ksi,\nand 32.23 – 38.97%. The 350W – 0.047” thick samples have an average yield strength, ultimate\ntensile strength, and fracture elongation in the range of 73.57 – 89.58 ksi, 142.37 – 147.61 ksi, and\n25.32 – 30.97%. The 0.047” thick single-pass samples, which have very large grain size, display\nexcellent strain hardening exponent that are critical for LRE nozzle application. It is encouraging\nto note that NASA HR-1 is suitable for fabricating very thin panels using the LP-DED method.\nOne 1070W – 0.6” diameter round bar sample that has the highest tensile strength was selected\nfrom each aging treatment to compare the strain hardening behavior. Signs of high strain harden-\ning capability are delayed necking, high elongation, and lower yield strength. As shown in Figure\n24, it is apparent that A4 2-step aging treatment, 1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h (total time of 32 hours),\nyields higher strain hardening capability than the others.\n36",

Overlaid stress-strain curves for the round bar samples (1070 W–0.6” diameter) that\nhave the highest tensile strength from each aging treatment group.\nOne key takeaway from the tensile data analysis is A4 2-step aging treatment yields signifi-\ncantly higher tensile ductility and strain hardening exponent than the standard single-step aging\ntreatment (1325 °F/16h). The strain hardening exponent ranking is A4 > A2 > A3 > A1. The mate-\nrial that has high strain hardening exponent can store more strain energy, diffuse deformation,\nand improve LCF performance. Strain hardening behavior is microstructure dependent and the\nimproved strain hardening capability with A4 2-step aging can be attributed to high solute con-\ntents and the presence of finer and underaged γ′ precipitate. The solute contents in the alloy can\nenhance the efficiency of dislocation storage during plastic deformation and increase the level of\nstrain hardening. As nucleation and growth of γ′ precipitate consumes more free solutes, an oppo-\nsite evolution trend of strain hardening (n) is observed. Therefore, A4 (1275 °F/16h + 1150 °F/16h)\nis the most promising and has been selected as the new aging treatment for LP-DED NASA HR-1.\nThe evolution of post-processing heat treatment for LP-DED NASA HR-1 from the early stage\nheat treatment to the new heat treatment is given in Figure 25.\n38\n)isp(\nssertS\ngnireenignE",

The evolution of post-processing heat treatment for LP-DED NASA HR-1.\nIn summary, LP-DED NASA HR-1 exhibits expected trends in tensile strength and ductil-\nity as temperatures of aging cycles are reduced. Changes from the standard single step aging cycle\nto a lower temperature two step aging cycle resulted in improved fracture elongation and strain\nhardening behavior, which is important for components that need excellent low cycle fatigue resis-\ntance. LP-DED NASA HR-1 exhibits lower yield and ultimate tensile strengths than the wrought\nalloy. This strength reduction is part of the trade to optimizing the alloy for LRE applications.\nHowever, ductility of LP-DED NASA HR-1 is significantly higher than that of the wrought alloy\ndue to optimization of chemical composition and heat treatment. LCF performance, which is the\nprimary service life limit factor for LRE nozzles, is expected to increase to the same level of the\nwrought alloy.\n3.4 Key Materials Properties\n3.4.1 Temperature-Dependent Tensile Properties in Ambient Air.\nFigure 26 shows the typical microstructure evolution of LP-DED NASA HR-1 multi-pass\nsamples before and after heat treatment. Layer melt pool boundaries with different columnar den-\ndritic morphologies can be clearly seen in the as-built state. The microstructure consists of recrys-\ntallized grains and annealed twins after heat treatment as shown in Figure 26(d). The typical grain\nsize varies from approximately 50 – 250 µm. Grain boundaries look very clean as the undesirable\ngrain-boundary η phase is reduced to a very low level with the new heat treatment.\n39",

Tensile fracture elongation is typically proportional to the value of\nstrain hardening exponent (n) as high strain hardening capability can homogenize plastic deforma-\ntion and retard tensile fracture initiation. Therefore, the improved ductility in cryogenic tempera-\ntures can be attributed to the enhanced strain hardening capability that makes deformation more\nhomogeneous and stable prior to fracture.\nThe specimens aged with single-step aging cycle have higher strength but lower fracture\nelongation and strain hardening exponent. On the other hand, the specimens that were subjected\nto two-step aging treatment exhibits lower strength but higher fracture elongation and strain hard-\nening exponent. Strain hardening exponent for LP-DED NASA HR-1 can vary due to the change\nin the solid solution concentration of γ-matrix and the size and distribution of γ′ strengthening\nprecipitate. The concentration of Ti and Al in the γ-matrix solid solution in 2-step aged condition\nis higher than that in the 1-step aged condition because the material is significantly underaged\nafter 2-step aging cycle. The increase in strain hardening exponent can be attributed to higher sol-\nute concentration (Ti and Al) in γ matrix and the presence of finer tertiary γ′ and more uniformly\ndistributed secondary γ′ precipitate structure. Higher Ti and Al concentration in γ-matrix enables\nthe material to store more dislocations during tensile deformation and lead to enhanced strain\nhardening capability.\nThe engineering stress vs. strain curves of LP-DED NASA HR-1 tested at –320 °F, room\ntemperature and 1200 °F were selected to compare strain hardening behavior as a function of tem-\nperature. As shown in Figure 27, it is apparent that the flow stress and strain hardening behavior\nare strongly influenced by test temperature and aging cycles. Serrated stress-strain flow behavior\nwas observed for the 2-step aged samples tested at 1200 °F, which is indicative of dynamic strain\naging (DSA). The repeated locking and unlocking of dislocations create serrations in stress-strain\ncurves, which is known as DSA.46 DSA is commonly seen in many Ni-based superalloys during\ntensile deformation at elevated temperatures.47 DSA generally occurs at a certain combination of\ntemperature and strain rate, where the diffusivity of the solute atom is sufficient to obstruct the\ndislocation motion. Serrations appear as a result of interaction of moving dislocations with the\ninterstitial or substitutional alloying elements. It is interesting to note that the 1-step aged sample\ndoes not appear to have serrated stress-strain flow behavior as shown in Figure 27(c). The 2-step\naged sample has more pronounced serrated stress-strain flow behavior that likely results from the\npresence of higher concentration of Ti and Al atoms in the γ-matrix solid solution (due to a high\ndegree of under-aging) that enhances dislocation pinning.\n42",

Wrought NASA\nHR-1 clearly has higher strength than LP-DED alloy under the same test temperatures. Although\nstrength decreases with increasing temperature, both yield and tensile strengths remain quite high\nup to 1200 °F for wrought NASA HR-1. Ti is the primary strengthening element as it combines with\nNi to forms the primary strengthening γ′ precipitate in NASA HR-1. The volume fraction of γ′ pre-\ncipitate is expected to be significantly reduced in LP-DED NASA HR-1 as the Ti content is reduced\nfrom 2.8% (in the wrought alloy) to 2.5% (in the LP-DED alloy). The strength reduction is part of\nthe trade when using LP-DED process to manufacture NASA HR-1 and is thus expected based on\nthe chemistry reformulation. However, LP-DED NASA HR-1 has significantly higher ductility than\nthe wrought alloy. The change from the standard single step aging cycle to a lower temperature two\nstep aging cycle resulted in further improvement in ductility.

For each aging condition,\nthere is significant cyclic strain hardening in the first 10 – 30 cycles. The peak tensile/compression\nstresses decreased slightly near the half cycle due to cyclic stabilization after the initial cyclic\nhardening.\nOne noticeable difference on the hysteresis loops is the degree of cyclic hardening between\nthe samples processed with different aging cycles. As shown in Figure 31, the samples that were\nheat treated with 2-step aging cycle show more pronounced cyclic hardening response than those\nheat treated with 1-step aging cycle. At 1% total strain, the peak tensile stress increased slightly\n(by 2.6 ksi) from 90.5 ksi at the 1st cycle to 93.1 ksi at the half life cycle for the 1-step aged sample.\nIn comparison, the peak tensile stress increased (by 7.2 ksi) from 77.7 ksi at the 1st cycle to 84.9 ksi\nat the half life cycle for the 2-step aged sample.

The evolution of peak tensile stress (σ ) and compres-\nmax\nsive stress (σ ) with respect to the number of cycles (N) at two different total strains is shown\nmin\nin Figure 33. The variation of tensile and compressive stress magnitude with number of cycle (N)\nis dependent on the applied total strain and the condition of aging. Both 1-step and 2-step aged\nsamples display significant cyclic strain hardening in the first 10 – 30 cycles. The initial cyclic hard-\nening was brief and the peak stress curve became noticeably flattened as cyclic hardening response\nleveled off. The peak stresses of 1-step aged samples were always higher than that of 2-step aged\nsamples before crack initiation. However, the 2-step aged samples exhibit more pronounced cyclic\nhardening than 1-step aged samples.\nBoth crack initiation life and fatigue life can be determined from the peak tensile stress\nvs. cycle (N) plot. The LCF specimens maintain a cyclically stable condition for approximately\n70 – 80% of the fatigue life until the onset of crack initiation (Ni), after which accelerated cyclic\nsoftening occurred. Onset of LCF crack initiation can be determined when a rapid drop in the\npeak tensile stress occurred. It is evident that most of the LCF life is spent in crack initiation.\nThe regime of rapid cyclic softening occurs at final stage of LCF testing, approximately within\nthe final 10 – 15% of the fatigue life. The growth of fatigue crack accelerated at late stage of LCF\ntesting and cyclic stress amplitude drops rapidly until final fracture. Final fracture of the LCF\nsamples was gradual as there is no sign of a sudden drop in the peak tensile stress amplitude after\ncrack initiation.\n49\n)isk(\nssertS\n)isk(\nssertS",

      "text": "The division of the total fatigue life into different stages (crack initiation, crack propagation,\nand final fracture) is an important consideration in regard to fatigue assessment.48 Many fatigue\nassessments focus on the stages when a fatigue crack grows to a detectable size. The LCF data indi-\ncates that two-step aging seems to be able to delay fatigue crack initiation, which is significant as\nengineering materials often contain inherent defects and the use of total life approaches can lead to\noverestimation of useful fatigue life. Some mechanical components are designed based on crack ini-\ntiation life as the problem in its initial stage (after the sign of initial crack initiation) can be efficiently\ncontrolled by NDE inspection to determine the extent of crack advance.48 In other words, it is safer\nto take preventive rather than corrective maintenance action to prevent unexpected catastrophic\nfailure. Overall, 2-step aging is better suited for LCF critical applications than one-step aging as it\nleads to longer LCF life by making the material more ductile, enhancing strain hardening capability\nand delaying crack initiation.\n3.4.2.3 Cyclic Hardening Analysis. In order to quantitatively compare the effects of strain\namplitude and aging treatment on the cyclic stress response, the ratios of cyclic hardening and\ncyclic softening were calculated. Cyclic hardening ratio (HR) and cyclic softening ratio (SR) can be\nexpressed as follows:\n= (⊗σ\nmax\n– ⊗σ\nfirst\n)/ ⊗σ\nfirst\n(5)\n= (⊗σ\nmax\n– ⊗σ\nhalf\n)/ ⊗σ\nmax\n(6)\nWhere Δσ , Δσ , and Δσ represent the stress amplitudes at the maximum, first cycle and\nmax first half\nhalf cycle, respectively.45,50 Table 10 shows the comparison of the stress amplitudes at the maximum\n(Δσ ), first cycle (Δσ ) and half-life (Δσ ) cycles for LP-DED NASA HR-1 in both 1-step and\nmax first half\n2-step aged conditions. As can be seen in Table 10, the 2-step aged specimens exhibited higher HR\nand lower SR than the 1-step aged specimens at both 1% and 2% total strain. The hardening ratio\n(HR) and softening ratio (SR) as a function of the total strain are shown in Figure 34. Both HR and\nSR values increase with increasing strain amplitude. The samples in 2-step aged condition exhibit\nhigher HR but lower SR than those in 1-step aged condition. As a result, the 2-step aged samples\nexhibit larger differences between the values of HR and SR than the 1-step aged samples at both\ntotal stain amplitudes. HR and SR are two important parameters in characterizing cyclic deforma-\ntion behavior. Higher HR and lower SR indicate enhanced cyclic hardening that enables the cyclic\nplastic deformation to become more homogeneous. These observations further confirm that 2-step\naging is better suited for LCF critical applications than 1-step aging.\n51",

Fatigue life of a component can be divided to five stages: dis-\nlocation movement, crack nucleation, micro-crack propagation, macro-crack propagation, and\nthe final fracture.48 The first three stages are treated as the crack initiation phase followed by a\nmacro-crack propagation phase and final fracture. Figure 35 and 36 provides details regarding\nLCF fracture behavior of LP-DED NASA HR-1, such as crack initiation and crack propagation,\nunder 1% and 2% total strain amplitudes. The LCF specimens were heat treated with two different\naging cycles. There are three distinct zones on the fracture surface consisting of fatigue crack ini-\ntiation, crack propagation, and final fast-fracture regions (as indicated by dashed white and yellow\nlines). There are multiple crack initiation sites in each specimen. It can be seen from Figure 35 that\nthe fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface at 1% total strain in both 1-step and 2-step\naged specimens. As shown in Figure 35(c), the crack initiation site has distinct slip bands along\ncertain crystallographic planes and directions. Slip bands are a result of the systematic buildup of\nfine dislocation slip movements.\nThere are multiple crack initiation sites in the crack initiation region at 2% total strain\nand the small cracks grew along several different directions in the early stage of crack propaga-\ntion. The cracks grew, coalesced, and propagated further until the final fracture. Striation marks\nare very distinct in the fatigue propagation zone as shown in Figure 35(d). The striation spacing\nduring the early stage of crack propagation ranges from 0.5 – 1 µm at 1% total strain. At 2% total\nstrain (see Fig. 36), the fatigue crack also initiated along certain crystallographic planes near the\nspecimen surface. Some fatigue propagation striations can be clearly seen, although a significant\nportion of the fracture surface was smeared due to repeated tensile-compression loadings. At 2%\ntotal strain, the striation spacing is approximately 2 – 10 µm during the early stage of crack propa-\ngation. The width of a striation increases significantly when the total strain increases from 1% to\n2% as the increase in stress intensity leads to higher fatigue crack growth rate.\nFatigue striation mark is the typical characteristic of crack propagation in a very ductile\nmaterial.45 Striations on the fatigue fracture surface show the incremental growth of a fatigue\ncrack. Each striation represents fatigue crack growth per cycle and the width of a striation is\nindicative of the overall crack growth rate. There is no sign that the fatigue cracks initiated from\nthe near surface defects, such as internal pores. The small fatigue cracks grew and coalesced and\nadvanced further in a direction normal to the applied stress, forming a large propagation zone.\nThe final fracture area is significantly larger when the total strain was increased from 1% to 2%.\nThe most noticeable differences between the two aging cycles (1-step vs., 2-step aging) were in the\ncrack propagation zone. The crack propagation zone appears to be larger in 2-step aged specimen,\nwhich correlates well with its higher cyclic hardening capability and longer LCF life.\n53",

      "text": "The variation in the GH /GHe ductility ratio between LP-DED NASA HR-1 and the\n2\nwrought alloy can be attributed to the discrepancy in the tensile testing strain rate. The tensile\ntesting strain rate for LP-DED NASA HR-1 is 0.0001 in/in/min, which is approximately 20 – 30\ntimes times slower than that for the wrought alloy (0.005 in/in/min). The reduction in strain rate\nincreases the exposure time in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment from approximately\n20 – 25 minutes (0.005 in/in/min) for the wrought alloy to roughly 450 – 650 minutes (0.0001 in/in/\nmin) for the LP-DED alloy. Since dislocation motion and its interaction with hydrogen is highly\nstrain rate sensitive, the HEE effects are expected to become more pronounced when tensile test-\ning at a slower strain rate.51 The use of tensile ductility ratio (as shown in Table 12) is intended for\ninitial screening to gauge the effects of HEE and should not be used for component design. Addi-\ntional mechanical testing in high pressure hydrogen environment is needed to evaluate the effects\nof hydrogen on other critical mechanical properties such as low cycle fatigue, high cycle fatigue,\nand fatigue crack growth, etc.\nTable 12.

All specimens display con-\ntinuous strain hardening before reaching the UTS. Distinct necking can be observed from the\nstress-strain curves and the development of tensile fracture was gradual as there is still 4 – 5 % duc-\ntility (fracture elongation) between the onset of necking and final fracture. Serrated stress-strain\nbehavior was found for both 1-step and 2-step aged samples in hydrogen, indicative of Portevin-Le\nChatelier (PLC) effect.52 The PLC effect manifests itself as an unstable plastic flow during tensile\ntesting under certain conditions of strain rate and temperature. It has been reported that hydro-\ngen can trigger PLC effect in traditional wrought and AM 718 alloy at room temperature.52 The\nserrated stress-strain flow behavior is caused by the dragging effect of hydrogen atoms on disloca-\ntions. Occurrence of a drag force requires two conditions: (1) formation of hydrogen atmospheres\nat the dislocations and (2) the hydrogen atmospheres move with but lag behind the dislocations.\nThe drag force of hydrogen atoms is strain rate dependent. Lower strain rate increases the drag\nforce because reduced strain rate permits more competitive motion between hydrogen atoms and\ndislocations to form hydrogen atmospheres around the dislocations. As a result, repeated locking\nand unlocking of dislocations by hydrogen creates serrations in the stress-strain curves.\n59",

Engineering stress-strain curves of LP-DED NASA HR-1 tensile tested in high\npressure helium and hydrogen environment in (a) 1-step aged and (b) 2-step aged\nconditions. Serrated stress-strain flow behavior is observed for samples tested in\nhigh pressure hydrogen environment.\nPlastic deformation occurs more uniformly in the initial stages of a tensile test as the dif-\nfusion distance of hydrogen is still very short. As tensile testing continues, the dislocation density\ncontinues to increase and more hydrogen atoms can be transported and accumulate in the regions\nwith high plastic deformation. For LP-DED NASA HR-1 in 1-step aged condition, the PLC effects\nbecome more pronounced when the plastic strain exceeds 12% as hydrogen is increasingly accu-\nmulated in the regions that have high dislocation density. The effects of HEE became more pro-\nnounced when the plastic instability occurs after the onset of necking. PLC results in localization\nof plastic deformation and the serrations become more intense in the post-necking region when\nlocal damage occurred.53 The serrations on the stress-strain curves are more pronounced in the\n1- step aged specimen than in the 2-step aged specimen, which may be caused by the difference\nin their strain hardening behavior. Compared with the 2-step aged samples, the samples in 1-step\naged condition exhibit lower strain-hardening capability. As a result, deformation takes place by\nmore heterogeneous dislocation slip that results in deformation localization and more pronounced\nPLC effects.54\n3.4.3.1 Hydrogen-induced surface cracking. Surface characteristics of tensile tested\nspecimens were analyzed using optical microscopy. As shown in Figure 40, the specimen surface\nexhibited unusual “orange peel” appearance after prolonged tensile testing in high pressure\nhydrogen environment. Many surface cracks are present and distributed along the machining\nmarks. Per the ASTM G-142 standard, tensile specimen for evaluation of hydrogen effect should\nbe machined to have a surface finish of 32 µin or better to minimize the amount of cold work on\nthe gauge surface. However, examination of specimen surface finish found the gage surface finish\nis approximately 75 µin, which is significantly coarser than the 32 µin specified by ASTM G-142.\n60\n)isk(\nssertS\ngnireenignE\n)isk(\nssertS\ngnireenignE",

      "text": "3.4.3.2 Hydrogen Diffusion Analysis and Strain Rate Effects. For metals stressed in a gas-\neous hydrogen environment, hydrogen-induced crack initiation typically starts at the gas-metal\nsurface.56 Hydrogen can dissociate on metal surfaces into H-atom and be physically absorbed and\ntransported by diffusion through metal lattice. Upon further loading, the absorbed H-atom can\nbe transported by dislocations to the regions of high stress and interacts with the material at the\ncrack tip. In alloy 718 (Inconel 718), the resistance to HEE is related to hydrogen diffusion behavior\nand hydrogen transport by diffusion is an important consideration for interpreting susceptibil-\nity to HEE.57 Diffusivity of hydrogen in superalloys varies slightly with composition of alloys.\nThe diffusivity of lattice hydrogen at room temperature is on the order of 10–16 m2/s in Fe-Cr-Ni\naustenitic steels and 2× 10–15 m2/s in alloy 718.58,59 The depth of hydrogen diffusion in LP-DED\nNASA HR-1 was estimated using the bulk diffusivity of alloy 718 in hydrogen at room temperature\n(2 × 10–15 m2/s). The diffusion distance of hydrogen has a square root dependence on diffusivity and\ncan be determined from the Equation below:\n∼ (7)\nwhere x is the diffusion distance traveled by the diffusing hydrogen atoms in one direction\nalong one axis, D is diffusivity, and t is the elapsed time since diffusion began.58 The diffusivity\ndetermines the time it takes for a hydrogen atom to diffuse a given distance in an alloy. Diffusion\ntime increases with the square of diffusion distance and is inversely proportional to the diffusivity\n(D).\nThe tensile testing strain rate for LP-DED NASA HR-1 in hydrogen is 0.0001 in/in/min, which\nis more than an order of magnitude slower than that for the wrought alloy (0.005 in/in/min). The\nreduction in strain rate increases the testing time in a high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment\nfrom 20 – 25 minutes (at 0.005 in/in/min) for the wrought alloy to 450 – 650 minutes (at 0.0001 in/in/\nmin strain rate) for the LP-DED alloy. When a tensile test is performed at a strain rate of 0.005 in/in/\nmin strain rate) for 20 – 25 minutes, hydrogen atoms were able to diffuse over a distance of approxi-\nmately 1.55 – 1.73 µm. In comparison, when the strain rate is decresased to 0.0001 in/in/min, the\nexposure time in the hydrogen environment increases to 450 – 650 minutes, and the estimated depth\nof hydrogen diffusion at failure would increase from 2.19 to approximately 7.35 – 8.83 µm. Therefore,\nthe fraction of deforming material that is affected by hydrogen is considerably larger at 0.0001 in/\nin/min than at 0.005 in/in/min strain rate as the exposure time to high pressure hydrogen increased\nfrom 20 – 25 minutes to more than 450 minutes. This explains why HEE is more pronounced when\ntensile testing is performed at a lower strain rate.\nThe calculated hydrogen diffusion distance of 7.35 – 8.83 µm (at 0.0001 in/in/min strain rate)\nis shorter than the observed depth of surface cracks, which is 20 – 100 µm in most cases. The discre-\npencies could be caused by enhanded lattice diffusivity of hydrogen due to expanded crystal lattice\n(by elastic strain) or by dislocation asssisted transporation. HEE is more pronounced at a lower\nstrain rate because slow strain rate increases testing duration and promotes interaction of hydrogen\nand the moving dislocations.59,60 At a higher strain rate, the diffusion of hydrogen may not be able\nto follow the dislocation motion. In contrast, hydrogen can diffuse deeper and follow the disloca-\ntion motion when strain rate is decreased to a certain level. Therefore, the interaction of hydrogen\n64",

High pressure gaseous hydro-\ngen environment is known to have a considerable effect on LCF properties for HEE susceptible\nmaterials. In general, the strain-controlled LCF test is more sensitive to HEE than the load-con-\ntrolled high cycle fatigue (HCF) test.26 The greatest reduction in LCF life in high pressure hydro-\ngen environment is found at near room temperature for most superalloys. Therefore, LCF testing\nwas performed in 5 ksi gaseous hydrogen environment at room temperature at a strain ratio of –1\n(R = –1) and a total strain of 2% to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on fatigue crack initiation and\ncycles to failure. The selection of 2% total strain range for LCF test in hydrogen is based on the\nprojection that the maximum total strain the channel wall nozzle experiences during hot firing is\naround 2% in most cases.61 Table 13 shows the LCF test results that include inelastic strain range,\ncycles to crack initiation, and cycles to failure. The LCF samples were heat treated with two differ-\nent aging cycles. The inelastic strain increased slightly when the aging treatment is switched from\n1-step to 2-step. The samples heat treated with 2-step aging cycle exhibit longer crack initiation life\n(Ni = 860 – 865 cycles) than those heat treated with 1-step aging (Ni = 660 –760 cycles). Samples in\n2-step aged condition also exhibit slightly longer LCF life than that in 1-step aged condition.\nTable 13.

The hysteresis loops are nearly symmetrical under both\naging conditions. There is significant cyclic hardening in the early cycles and the strain hardening\nresponse stabilizes and reaches a steady state near the half-life cycle. One noticeable difference is\nthe level of cyclic hardening varies with aging treatment. As shown in Figure 45, the peak cyclic\ntensile stress increased by 12.9 ksi from 97.1 ksi in the 1st cycle to 110.0 ksi at the half life cycle in\n1-step aged condition. In comparison, the peak tensile stress increased by 19.3 ksi from 80.2 in\nthe 1st cycle to 99.5 ksi at the half life cycle in 2-step aged condition. It is evident that 2-step aging\nenhances cyclic hardening response.

Variations of peak tensile stress (σ ) and compressive stress (σ ) with number of\nmax min\ncycles (N) at 2% total strain (1% strain amplitude) in high pressure gaseous hydrogen\nenvironment. The LCF specimens were heat treated with two different aging cycles.\nThe total LCF life can be divided into two parts: crack initiation life and crack propagation\nlife. It is often considered that the fatigue life is determined by crack initiation cycle, Ni. After the\nNi cycle, crack propagation accelerates and the load carrying capability of the component drops\nquickly. Due to the presence of a sizable crack, the component becomes fracture critical, and its\nsafety and reliability depend on damage tolerance assessment and control. 2-step aging appears to\nprovide a higher resistance to crack initiation that can be attributed to the enhanced cyclic hard-\nening capability (higher HR and lower SR) as shown in Table 14. Therefore, 2-step aging treatment\nis better suited for components that are to be used for LCF critical applications in high pressure\nhydrogen environments, such as some HEE sensitive components for LRE applications.\n3.4.4.3 LCF Induced Fracture Features in Hydrogen. SEM was used to examine the frac-\nture surfaces to observe the effects of hydrogen on LCF fracture behavior. Figure 47 shows the\nfracture surfaces of LP-DED NASA HR-1 samples in two different aging conditions. There are\nthree distinct regions on the fracture surface that consist of fatigue-crack initiation, crack propa-\ngation, and final fast-fracture zones (as indicated by dashed white and yellow lines). It can be seen\nfrom Figure 48(a) that the fatigue crack initiated from the specimen surface, caused by localized\ndislocation slip bands on certain crystallographic planes. Slip bands are a result of the system-\natic buildup of fine dislocation slip movements. There is no sign that the fatigue cracks initiated\nfrom the near surface defects, such as internal pores.

The small fatigue cracks grew, coalesced, and advanced further in\na direction normal to the applied stress, forming a large propagation zone as shown in Figure 47.\nBoth 1-step and 2-step aged specimens exhibit similar fracture surface characteristics. The most\nnoticeable difference between the samples tested in ambient air (see Fig. 36) and in 5 ksi hydro-\ngen environment (see Fig. 47) is in the crack initiation stage. The LCF samples tested in hydro-\ngen exhibit an increase in the crack initiation density (more fatigue crack initiation sites in the\ninitiation zone) than that tested in ambient air. This is consistent with the findings that hydrogen\nincreases the density of fatigue induced surface cracks due to enhanced interaction of dislocation\nslip bands with hydrogen.62\n1-step, LCF, GH\n2\n2-step, LCF, GH\n2\n(a) (b)\nFigure 47.

There are distinct striation marks in the fatigue propagation zone\nas shown in Figure 48. Striations are fatigue propagation marks produced on the fracture surface\nthat show the incremental growth of a fatigue crack. Striations are generally not seen when a crack\nis small, but begin to appear as the crack becomes larger. Each striation represents fatigue crack\ngrowth per cycle and the width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate. The\nstriation spacing during the early stage of crack propagation ranges from 10 – 20 µm. Fatigue stria-\ntion mark is the typical characteristic of crack propagation in a very ductile material.44 Therefore,\nthe presence of distinct fatigue striations indicates LP-DED NASA HR-1 remains very ductile\nduring LCF testing in high pressure hydrogen environment.\n72",

The cyclic hardening behavior of wrought\nNASA HR-1 is not known as the LCF hysteresis loop data is unavailable. However, cyclic hard-\nening behavior can be estimated using the tensile UTS/YS ratio.63 Table 15 compares the tensile\nproperties and UTS/YS ratio for LP-DED and wrought NASA HR-1 in high pressure helium and\nhydrogen environments.64 As shown, wrought NASA HR-1 has lower UTS/YS ratio (1.34 – 1.36)\nthan the LP-DED alloy (1.64 – 1.87) in high pressure hydrogen environment. Having a lower UTS/\nYS ratio suggests the wrought alloy would have lower cyclic hardening capability than the LP-\nDED alloy.

      "text": "Thermal conductivity determined at MSFC for LP-DED NASA HR-1 (initial composi-\ntion) is in line with that of the wrought alloy but lower than the literature data for LP-DED NASA\nHR-1 (final formulation).6 It is well known that alloying elements decrease the thermal conductiv-\nity of superalloys, and the thermal conductivity of superalloys is only 10 to 30% that of pure iron,\nor pure nickel due to the effect of extensive alloying.69,70 Wrought NASA HR-1 has higher alloying\nelements content than the DED alloy, which is expected to contribute to lower values of thermal\nconductivity. In addition, LP-DED NASA HR-1 powder has tighter chemical composition con-\ntrol and lower impurity level than the wrought alloy. In metals, heat transfer is primarily carried\nby electrons and impurities will distort crystal lattice, impede electron movement, and reduce\nconductivity.71 Comparing to the wrought alloy (having the highest alloying element content), the\nreduced alloying element content and lower impurity level maybe the reasons that contribute to\nincreased thermal conductivity for LP-DED NASA HR-1. Although there are some variations in\nthe measured thermophysical properties across different testing labs, it can be concluded that LP-\nDED NASA HR-1 (final formulation) has higher thermal conductivity than the wrought alloy. The\nincrease in thermal conductivity can be attributed to the optimization of chemical composition\nand heat treatment LP-DED NASA HR-1 to obtain an optimal balance of key material properties.\n3.5 Hardware manufacturing\nNASA, along with industry partners, has manufactured various components using the\nNASA HR-1 alloy. These components have been fabricated as manufacturing technology dem-\nonstrators (MTD’s) and completed various hot-fire testing campaigns to demonstrate in the\nactual hydrogen environment (Fig. 55). Several components were deposited using 350W, 1070W,\nand 2620W power parameters using LP-DED. The lower power allows for thin walls deposited\nat approximately 1 mm generally used for channel wall nozzles. The higher power increases the\ndeposition rates for thicker wall components that are often final machined and have limited inter-\nnal features. The components demonstrated include powerhead half shells used for the RS-25\npowerhead, manifolds for nozzles and chambers, transfer tubes, domes, and other pressure loaded\ncomponents that are used in hydrogen environments. The LP-DED process was also used to build\na MTD at 1.52 meter diameter and 1.78 meter height, approximately a 65% scale RS-25 channel\nwall nozzle (Fig. 55(c)).\n84",

Another test campaign (PJ062, LOX/\nHydrogen) demonstrated high duty cycle hot-fire testing of a single NASA HR-1 LP-DED nozzle\nat 2000-lbf thrust and achieved 207 starts and almost 6,800 seconds at a chamber pressure of 1080\npsig and mixture up to 7.4.

Additional NASA HR-1 LP-DED units were tested under this campaign\nwith unique design features including a scalloped hotwall (tube-like) and spiral channels.

CONCLUSIONS\n(1) The Fe-Ni-Cr hydrogen-resistant NASA HR-1 alloy using additive manufactured\n(AM) laser powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) has matured through process\ndevelopment, material characterization, and optimization of chemical composition and heat\ntreatment. NASA HR-1 meets materials requirements for liquid rocket engine components\nand NASA has completed fabrication of several subscale and full-scale channel wall nozzles in\nLP-DED NASA HR-1 and completed hot-fire testing.\n(2) The chemical composition of wrought NASA HR-1 was modified for AM using\nthe PHACOMP method. An optimal composition (final formulation) has been determined by\ndecreasing the overall Md value to retard precipitation of undesirable η phase and obtain an\noptimal balance of key materials properties. The optimized final formulation is shown below:\nAlloy Fe Ni Cr Mo V W Co Ti Al\nLP-DED NASA HR–1\n41.20 34.00 14.60 1.80 0.30 1.60 3.80 2.40 0.25\n(Final Formulation)\n(3) A new post-processing heat treatment has been successfully developed for LP-DED\nNASA HR-1. The optimized stress relief and homogenization treatments can effectively mitigate\nelemental segregation and produce highly recrystallized microstructure. The subsequent solution\nanneal and aging treatment help control precipitation kinetics of γ′ and mitigate precipiation of\nundersirable grain boundary η phase. The optimized heat treatment process consists of the fol-\nlowing steps:\n– Stress relief at 1950 °F/1.5 hours with slow furnace cool,\n– Homogenization at 2125 °F/6 hours with argon quench,\n– Solution annealing at 1950 °F/1 hour with argon quench or faster,\n– 2-step Aging at 1275 °F/16 hours + 1150 °F/16 hours (total time is 32 hours).\n(4) Comparing with the wrought alloy, LP-DED NASA HR-1 exhibits lower strength,\nbut significantly higher ductility and strain hardening capability. Strength reduction is part of the\ntrade to obtain an optimal balance of key material properties when using AM. Ductility of LP-\nDED NASA HR-1 is slightly impacted when tensile tested at a very slow strain rate of 0.0001 in/in/\nmin in hydrogen. However, the 2-step aged material remains very ductile and has more than 33%\nfracture elongation after tensile testing in hydrogen for 8–10 hours.\n(5) The combined effects of chemical composition and heat treatment optimization\nenable high quality NASA HR-1 components to be fabricated via the LP-DED method.

      "text": "from the standard single step aging cycle to a lower temperature two step aging cycle alter\nthe characteristics of LP-DED NASA HR-1 by decreasing the size and volume fraction of γ ′\nprecipitate and retarding precipitation of the detrimental η phase. As a result, LP-DED NASA\nHR-1 becomes more ductile and LCF resistant, which is important for low cycle fatigue critical\ncomponents such as the LRE nozzles.\n(6) The LCF performance of LP-DED NASA HR-1 in 2-step aged condition is compa-\nrable to that of the wrought alloy in ambient air. However, LP-DED NASA HR-1 performs much\nbetter than the wrought alloy when LCF testing is conducted in a high-pressure gaseous hydrogen\nenvironment. Due to its exceptional ductility and enhanced strain hardening capability, the LCF\nlife of LP-DED NASA HR-1 is only slightly influenced by hydrogen, which is vital for the success\nand safety of LRE nozzles.\n88",
