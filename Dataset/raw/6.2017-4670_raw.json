Locci6\nUniversity of Toledo, Cleveland, OH\nNASA and industry partners are working towards fabrication process development to reduce\ncosts and schedules associated with manufacturing liquid rocket engine components with the goal\nof reducing overall mission costs. One such technique being evaluated is powder-bed fusion or\nselective laser melting (SLM), commonly referred to as additive manufacturing (AM). The NASA\nLow Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) program was designed to develop processes and\nmaterial characterization for GRCop-84 (a NASA Glenn Research Center-developed copper,\nchrome, niobium alloy) commensurate with powder-bed AM, evaluate bimetallic deposition, and\ncomplete testing of a full scale combustion chamber. As part of this development, the process has\nbeen transferred to industry partners to enable a long-term supply chain of monolithic copper\ncombustion chambers. To advance the processes further and allow for optimization with multiple\nmaterials, NASA is also investigating the feasibility of bimetallic AM chambers. In addition to the\nLCUSP program, NASA has completed a series of development programs and hot-fire tests to\ndemonstrate SLM GRCop-84 and other AM techniques. NASA’s efforts include a 4K lb thrust f\nliquid oxygen/methane (LOX/CH4) combustion chamber and subscale thrust chambers for 1.2K\nlb LOX/hydrogen (H2) applications that have been designed and fabricated with SLM GRCop-\nf\n84. The same technologies for these lower thrust applications are being applied to 25-35K lb main\nf\ncombustion chamber (MCC) designs. This paper describes the design, development,\nmanufacturing and testing of these numerous combustion chambers, and the associated lessons\nlearned throughout their design and development processes.\nNomenclature\nAM = Additive Manufacturing\nBSE = Backscatter Electron\nCT = Computer Tomography\nDED = Directed Energy Deposition\nDMD = Direct Metal Deposition\nDMLS = Direct Metal Laser Sintering\nEB = Electron Beam welding\n_______________________________\n1 Combustion Devices Engineer, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n2 Combustion Devices Engineer, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n3 Combustion Devices Engineer, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n4 Materials Research Engineer, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH 44135\n5 Materials Research Engineer, NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH 44135\n6 Principle Researcher, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH 43606\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n|\ngro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD\nAIAA 2017-4670\nAIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum\n10-12 July 2017, Atlanta, GA\n53rd AIAA/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference\nThis material is declared a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.",

Introduction\nA\ndditive Manufacturing (AM) technologies continue to evolve and mature creating opportunities for application\nto liquid rocket propulsion systems. Several new individual techniques and combinations of techniques appear\nto offer options to mitigate production time and significantly reduce cost and schedule in liquid rocket chambers and\nnozzles, if the enabling technology challenges can be solved. Specifically, high pressure/high temperature combustion\nchambers and nozzles must be regeneratively (regen) cooled to survive their operating environment, causing their\ndesign fabrication to be costly and time consuming, due to the number of individual steps and different processes\nrequired. Traditional cooled chambers and nozzles require either the closeout of milled passages or the bonding of\ntubes together. AM offers the design and fabrication options not previously possible with other manufacturing\ntechniques including complex internal and integral design features. This allows for an overall reduction in the\nassembly and elimination of joints. Additive manufacturing is not a process that will replace all traditional processes,\nbut it does provide significant advantages, and NASA is exploring the use of AM for chambers and nozzles through\ndesign, development and hot-fire testing.\nWhile AM processes, specifically powder bed fusion (PBF) or selective laser melting (SLM), have matured over\nthe last decade for a variety of materials, a limited number of metals are available using this process. SLM for\naerospace components has primarily focused on superalloys. NASA, under the Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion\n(LCUSP) program has advanced the printing process for copper alloys, specifically the NASA Glenn Research Center\n(GRC) developed GRCop-84 (Cu-8 at.% Cr-4 at.% Nb). This NASA-led project has matured the process significantly\nand also made process parameters and characterization data available to industry to enable commercial supply chains.\nSeveral industry partners have continued to advance the GRCop-84 material in addition to exploring other copper-\nalloys such as C-18150, C-18200, C-18000 and Glidcop.\nThe design focus for the SLM process of the GRCop-84 material has been on combustion chambers, where high-\nstrength and higher thermal conductivity are required. GRCop-84 was developed at GRC as a non-heat treatable\ncopper-alloy for reusable combustion chambers that increases strain and fatigue capabilities over traditional copper-\nalloys. GRCop-84 has been an ideal material suited for the SLM processing. Through a variety of complementary\nprojects to the LCUSP program, NASA has designed, developed and tested combustion chambers using the SLM\nprocess and captured significant lessons learned.\nCombustion chambers provide an ideal component for AM to contain the high pressure coolant and route the inlet\nand outlet manifold distributions. AM replaces several traditional processes into a single build step, but does require\nseveral post-processing operations, which will be discussed later in this paper. Traditional channel wall combustion\nchambers have been fabricated using a vacuum-casted and subsequent spun-formed or near net shape forged copper\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n|\ngro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD",

The liner is then final machined and slotted to form the coolant channels and required hotwall thicknesses.\nCloseout processes for the channels have included electrodeposition of copper and nickel or various methods of\nfurnace and vacuum brazing, including pressure-assisted or Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) brazing2,3,4.\nSLM offers a new approach to fabricate pre-closeout coolant passages and makes alternate processes viable for\ncreating a structural jacket, and these new processes can significantly reduce fabrication costs and schedules. For\nnozzles, additive techniques such as SLM, directed energy deposition (DED) and direct metal deposition (DMD) offer\nthe opportunity to “print” one-piece units. NASA has been investigating several of the new AM techniques to\ndetermine their viability and to better understand the available savings offered. These techniques include:\n SLM or Powder-bed fusion, also known as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)\n Laser Cladding such as Directed Energy Deposition and Direct Metal Deposition\n Freeform Blown Powder Deposition\n Arc-based Deposition\n Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication\n Cold Spray Deposition\n Hybrid techniques using a combination of the above techniques and also hybrid additive /subtractive\ntechnologies\nWhile LCUSP was the primary development program, the benefit of the AM GRCop-84 process was realized early\nand several other programs were spun-off to enable further lessons learned of the process. NASA has completed a\nseries of development projects to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) and manufacturing readiness level\n(MRL) for the GRCop-84 additive manufacturing process as well as downstream processing techniques. These design,\ndevelopment, manufacturing and test projects have enabled various lessons learned. They include lessons in the design\nprocess, processing of SLM supply chain from powder to complete part, post-processing, bimetallic deposition, and\ntest operations of the AM components. These projects took place over 3 years from 2014 through 2017 and\ndevelopment work continues to improve upon the existing design and manufacturing processes being applied to other\nprograms. Additionally, industry vendors have picked up much of the development work to continue the longer-term\nsupply chain. The projects that will be discussed in this paper include the following:\n1) Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) Program for 35K lb Engines\nf\n2) Thrusters for Liquid Oxygen (LOX)/Methane In-Space engine applications\n3) 1.2K-lb Subscale Workhorse Test Chambers f\na) One-Piece workhorse\nb) Two-Piece workhorse\nc) Interchangeable Additive Liner Slip Jacket Chamber\nEach of these programs had varying objectives to advance the AM technology. This included detailed design and\nanalysis tools relative to the GRCop-84 AM process (design-for-AM), optimization of the AM build process,\ndetermining build feature limitations, post-processing (including powder removal, inspections, HIP, plate removal),\nassembly operations using welding techniques, machining strategies, and gathering hot-fire test data and build time\non the AM material. The additive process provided the opportunity to complete builds of several chambers and\nfeedback into the design cycle. Much of this learning was accomplished through build failures. The most common\nbuild failures observed were gross and micro-cracking resulting from residual stresses and material lifts caused by the\nre-coater arm/blade catching and often combined with short powder feeds. These build failures have led to redesigns\nof the chambers. The generic design changes to eliminate future failures often included thinning of material, addition\nof varying support features, or changing angles of walls and overhangs.\nII. Overview of SLM GRCop-84 Processing and Material\nA variety of copper-based alloys such as NARloy-Z (Cu-3 wt.% Ag-0.5 wt.% Zr) and C-18150 have been used for\ncombustion chambers in prior and current programs5. Development work of GRCop-84 under the LCUSP program\nhas advanced additive manufacturing of GRCop-84. Work is ongoing with plans to hot fire test at least one such\nsection in the Fall of 2017 as discussed below, but some preliminary material properties have been generated on SLM\nprocessed GRCop-84 that indicate that the liners will have properties consistent with conventional wrought product\ntested under the Reusable Launch Vehicle - Second Generation (RLV 2nd Gen) program6.\nIn SLM, a layer of powder tens of microns thick is spread on a flat plate. A laser melts the powder where solid\nmaterial is desired to turn the loose powder into solid metal. Additional layers of powder are spread and selectively\nmelted to form the desired shape. Loose powder is subsequently removed when the part is removed from the powder\nbed.\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n| gro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD",

      "text": "Several challenges exist in attempting to consolidate copper-based alloys using SLM. The first is that copper is\nhighly reflective in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum where many SLM machine lasers operate. The\nsecond is that the alloys are highly conductive, so any heat put into the powder bed is rapidly conducted away from\nthe melt pool. These two issues can limit the ability of an SLM laser to effectively melt copper-based alloys and form\na fully dense part with no unmelted powder incorporated into it.\nGRCop and GlidCop, two alloys that have been considered for rocket engines in the past7, have the unique problem\nthat both are dispersion strengthened by a high melting point phase, Cr Nb and Al O , respectively. Both of these\n2 2 3\nphases are less dense than copper and could float to the surface of the melt pool and segregate during SLM processing.\nNeither will be melted during normal SLM processing where the temperature of the melt pool is likely only a bit above\nthe melting point of copper.\nFinally, SLM processing leaves a surface finish roughly equivalent to the diameter of the powder used. Typically\na powder cut in the -325 mesh (<40 micron) range is used for SLM. Using the powder diameter as an approximation\nof the surface finish, the as built surface would have the rough equivalent of a 63 microinch machined surface. While\nthe exposed surfaces can be machined to a smoother finish, it is very difficult and more likely impossible to machine\nthe interior cooling channels of liners and other SLM parts. The rough surface will increase turbulent flow during\nengine operation. This will increase the pressure drop but also increase the heat transfer to the coolant. Whether the\nincreased benefits of greater heat transfer outweigh the increased pressure drop are likely going to be specific to each\ndesign, but designers do need to address the issue.\nIt was rapidly discovered that GRCop-84 was easily melted in the SLM process. Most likely, the 14 vol.% Cr Nb\n2\nphase is partially responsible for a higher absorption of laser energy than pure copper and results in easier heating\ninitially. The reflectivity of copper rapidly decreases with temperature, and the powder should absorb more energy\nfrom the laser and heat readily8.\nThe microstructure of the SLM GRCop-84 was examined by sectioning witness samples made at the same time as\nthe liner section. A typical micrograph is shown in Figure 1. For purposes of comparison, a micrograph of extruded\nGRCop-84 is also presented in Figure 1.

Backscattered Electron (BSE) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Images of (a) Extruded and\n(b) SLM GRCop-84.\nTwo observations were made. First, the SLM process did not result in segregation of the Cr2Nb precipitates. This\nis likely due to turbulence in the melt pool mixing the molten and solid particles. Once the laser moves away, the\nliquid-solid mixture would be rapidly solidified by the conduction of heat out of the material through the GRCop-84\nsubstrate. This apparently did not allow sufficient time for buoyancy effects to segregate the Cr Nb to the surface of\n2\nthe molten copper. The results was a very uniform distribution of Cr Nb throughout the sample.\n2\nThe second observation was that the Cr Nb appears to have been refined in size. The Cr Nb present in the as-\n2 2\nextruded material is actually an agglomeration of finer Cr Nb particles formed in liquid copper during the gas\n2\natomization process. It appears that thermal and perhaps mechanical forces acting upon the agglomerations break\nthem up and form the finer particles seen in the SLM sample.

Results to-date are promising, and\nsamples have been shown to produce bond strengths in family with GRCop-84 parent material strength. Further\nprocess refinement has been performed in the last several months to address issues related to geometry and heat\nloading in the fabrication of a large combustion chamber, and the result is the unit shown in Figure 7b that is expected\nto undergo hot-fire tests. An example of the specimen failure can be seen in Figure 10b within the GRCop material.\na b\nFigure 10.

      "text": "A. LESSONS LEARNED UNDER LCUSP\nAs the initial design was underway, the team was aware of historical lessons learned from SLM fabrication.\nTherefore, early builds consisted of wedges of the more complex geometries that would need to be printed. These\nwedges, like the one shown in Figure 11, demonstrated that features were printable before the team committed to full\nbuilds of chamber halves. Additional trial pieces were also printed to characterize the coolant passage feature sizes\nthat would result from a certain model geometry. These articles were structured light scanned as shown in Figure 11\nand demonstrated that for channel sizes down to 0.030”, no model corrections were needed and the channels could be\nexpected to be held to +/- 0.001”.\na b\nFigure 11.Structured light scan of a channel sizing part used to confirm model to as-built channel sizing.\nStructured light scanning was also used as the parts flowed through the entire processes. One result of these scans,\nlike the ones shown in Figure 12a, was to show that the SLM chamber halves held to <0.005” near the build plate and\nabout 0.010” at the opposite ends of the build (maximum Z-height). Other scans later in the process flow show how\nthe liner I.D. moved as further processes (HIP and EBF3) were completed. HIP of the SLM liners resulted in nearly\nno movement, while the EBF3 process had two interesting results. The first that the inner radius of the liner shrank\non order of 0.070” and second that the exit diameter of the throat spool expanded outward [see Figure 12b]. This\nsecond result was mitigated later builds as the process flow was changed to reduce the amount of Inconel that will be\ndeposited to the part and replace that with a forged close-out for the manifolds.\na b c\nFigure 12. (a) Structured light scans of post SLM, post HIP chamber halves, (b) post-EBF3 deposition and\npost HIP joined unit and (c) 2D cross section of post-EBF3 deposition.\nAs SLM parts are typically printed in a full bed of powder, the powder must be removed from internal passages\nafter the build completes. While this was considered a risk early on, because of the two-piece design of the LCUSP\nchamber, powder clearing was accomplished in 2 days. Pressurized air and sharp blows to the build plate were the\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n|\ngro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD",

Water flow testing (see Figure 13) was performed to visually confirm that all\nchannels were cleared by the gas flow, and it was discovered that one of the channels was partially blocked. Water\npressure and sharp blows cleared this passage also. Later designs for other parts included SLM printed manifolds,\nand powder removal in these cases was more difficult as discussed later in this paper.\nFigure 13. Water flow testing to confirm all channels were clear. In the LCUSP chamber design, one inlet\nfeeds three channels, as illustrated by the flow shown.\nAs the required chamber length exceeded the build box dimensions of the SLM machine utilized for fabrication of\nthese parts, a method of joining the two chamber halves had to be developed. An EB weld was selected, as the parts\nwould be in LaRC’s EBF3 machine for deposition. The LaRC developed process parameters for the EB weld of SLM\nGRCop-84 and demonstrated it on SLM trial rings as shown in Figure 14. This also resulted in process efficiencies\nas the parts were then already on the mandrel and ready for the next phase, Inconel jacket deposition, as soon as the\nEB beam weld was complete at the halves.

Since the operating pressures were low enough, this unit did not require a separate\nstructural jacket – the thickness of the copper was sufficient for containing pressure.

Due to the overall size of this chamber, it was a\nprime candidate to use the AM GRCop-84 process. The chamber was designed as an integral one-piece unit to fit\nwithin the standard 250x250x250mm build boxes for the Concept Laser M2 at MSFC and various vendors. The size\nof this hardware was also ideal for lower-cost fabrication and validation through hot-fire testing. A series of these\nworkhorse chambers were designed that allowed for varying configurations as the process was being developed and\nlessons learned. The development 3D printed chambers included: 1) One-piece combustion chambers, 2) Two-piece\nchambers, 3) bimetallic chambers and, 4) Slip-Jacket chambers. The objectives of these chambers were to allow\niterations of design changes while understanding the process and minimize test cost to prove the technology in a\nrelevant environment.\nThese new workhorse chambers were designed to meet chamber pressure up to 1100 psia and a range of MR\nrequirements, in addition to 2000 psig coolant pressure for both water-cooling and gaseous hydrogen cooling. The\nnozzle contour aft of the throat was modified for full expansion of the flow to allow for longer nozzles to be tested,\nsuch as composite nozzle extensions and regeneratively-cooled channel wall nozzles23. The channels were optimized\nto minimize wall temperatures with pressure drop being a secondary consideration since it is used as a development\nworkhorse unit. This enabled a rapid design process and minimized material for additive manufacturing. The baseline\nSLM chamber design channels had varying cross sectional area in the barrel, throat and nozzle sections. The SLM\ndesign allowed a smooth transition design between varying aspect ratios to minimize pressure drop in these regions.\nA constant hot wall thickness was maintained. The maximum wall temperatures are shown in Figure 22 and they are\nwithin previous test experience for the GRCop-84 material24.\nFigure 22.

      "text": "Figure 23. Additive design features in the 1.2K LOX/GH2 Combustion Chamber.\nThe initial SLM build of the one-piece chamber was completed at the MSFC materials lab. This build used a mix\nof virgin and recycled GRCop-84 powder, although exact mixing was unknown. The total build time for the chamber\nwas approximately 14 days. Following completion of the build and removal from the build box, a start-stop knit line\ncould be observed and also an area on the outer surface where some slight material curls were present. An initial\nattempt was made to remove powder from the chamber using a series of dead blows to the build plate and within\nthickened areas of the additive chamber. The chamber was then sent for Computer Tomography (CT) scanning to\nverify powder removal from the channels and manifolds. The first CT scan revealed a significant amount of powder\nwas present with >60% of the channels still blocked, as shown in Figure 24. It was determined the best method to\ncontinue with powder removal was to drill and tap the ports to allow for pressurized air to help with powder removal.\nThe chamber remained on the build plate for this operation.\nThe ports were each tapped manually using the port top surface as a primary datum and the outer circumference\nas the secondary datum for centerline alignment. A lesson learned has been to set up the ports manually (individually)\nfor tapping instead of an automated computer numerical control (CNC) setup due to potential distortions from the\nbuild process. At this stage of fabrication small cracks were observed in the thinner regions of the ribs. These cracks\nwere likely due to several conditions: 1) A stress riser as an artifact of the design, 2) Microcracks during solidification\nfrom the build, 3) A low cycle fatigue (LCF) or HCF condition present during the mallet blows from powder removal\nand machining of the ports, and 4) Brittleness of the material prior to the HIP conditioning26. These cracks were\nmonitored and saw some slight growth during continued powder removal operations.\nFollowing the port tapping, additional attempts were made at powder removal but continued to be a challenge.\nThere was no visible powder emanating from the chamber after continued rotation and mallet impacts. It was\ndetermined that the build plate would dampen the mallet blows and not much of that energy was being imparted into\nthe areas needed. The chamber was then removed from the build plate with a band saw; the build plate removal would\nhave typically been completed following HIP. Several attempts were made to remove the powder including high\npressure gaseous nitrogen (GN2) purges in conjunction with mallet impacts. A fair amount of powder was observed\nemanating from the part during these operations. However, an additional CT scan was run showing that 40% of the\nchannels were still blocked. Several more attempts were made at powder removal, and it was finally decided to cut a\ngroove in the outer diameter (OD) to allow direct access to the channels.\n18\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n|\ngro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD",

Post-Processing Techniques\n TIG braze repair of unbonded SLM parts worked very well; using identical filler material was ideal for\nsuccessful repairs.\no Include weld wire within SLM builds for use during repairs; this allows for compatible material.\n While removing powder prior to HIP is ideal, it can still be removed after HIP, since all powder may not\nconsolidate. A high pressure, high flow rate flush can aid with powder removal. It is recommended to remove\nas much as possible prior to HIP though.\n Water flow testing should be completed as early as possible in process after powder removal.\n Design for shrinkage and deformation within all processing steps, such as welding and deposition processes.\nVII. Conclusions\nA process for SLM fabrication for combustion chambers using GRCop-84 copper-alloy has been developed and\nshown to be feasible for liquid rocket engine applications. Several chambers in various thrust classes have been\ndesigned, developed and fabricated at MSFC. Each SLM build in all thrust classes has offered opportunities to develop\nlessons learned and incorporate them into future builds. GRC has completed significant characterization of the SLM\nAM GRCop-84 material and data will be available in further reports.\nNASA has completed hot-fire testing of several chamber units as of the publication of this paper in LOX/H2 and\nLOX/methane environments. The chambers were hot-fire tested in the as-built condition with no post-process of\ninternal coolant channels and only minor machining on external surfaces. All AM GRCop-84 chambers tested to date\nhave performed extremely well and have met all performance requirements. Hot-fire testing will be completed on\nseveral future units including the LCUSP Chamber, META4, MET1 and additional 1.2K workhorse units.\nA thorough understanding of the entire SLM process from model generation to end application should be\nunderstood to make use of lessons learned in processing of copper alloys. Many SLM builds are being contracted out,\nwhich in turn the full processing is being pushed onto the vendor. This includes model preparation, SLM fabrication,\npowder removal, removal from build plate, support removal, surface preparation, local grinding, heat treatments and\nfinal machining. These pre-processing steps such as model preparation and post-processing steps can have a significant\nimpact on the final quality of the component being built, so one should have an understanding of and provide specific\nrequirements relative to these.\nNASA is continuing to design, fabricate and hot-fire test chambers and combustion devices using GRCop-84,\nGlidcop and C-18150 copper-alloys. The LCUSP AM and META4 chambers have been fabricated that maximize the\ncurrent build limitation of 9.8” diameter with axial welds to maximize the length of the chamber. NASA is working\nprojects with industry to increase this scale to larger diameters and also evaluating concepts for multi-piece to enable\nlarger scale AM technologies.\nAdditive manufacturing of GRCop-84 using SLM has been developed, characterized and shown to meet intended\nmaterial properties, and validated through hot-fire testing in relevant environments. This process has the potential to\nsignificantly reduce fabrication times for liquid rocket engine combustion chambers over traditional fabrication\ntechniques.\n25\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n0764-7102.6/4152.01\n:IOD\n|\ngro.aaia.cra//:ptth\n|\n7102\n,81\nyluJ\nno\nSIONILLI\nFO\nYTISREVINU\nyb\ndedaolnwoD",
